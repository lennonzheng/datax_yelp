A person working the line inside assigns a table to you. The burger was OK, but not as good as Five Guys or Fudruckers. She appeared incapable of more than 1 word responses. The food was good, espeically the truffle fries. If you are just looking for the next trendy place Hopdoddy's is for you. Of course, we left and will never be going back!!! Great food, local ingredients. Decent bar. Probably the best burger and milkshake I've had in my life HANDS DOWN. The salt on the whipped cream was the bomb diggity. Full, hearty, big ass burgers. The truffle fries were a HUGE disappointment! The layout is Hella awkward and it is WAY TOO LOUD. Do not come here for a date night unless you sit outside. Tried the place for a second time. They have the best burger in a town with lousy burgers. Here is why my wife and I are never going back there: \n","their obnoxious treatment of customers. Great Happy Hour and burger specials\n","4. Interesting cocktails and shakes\n","5. Do you want Bennigan's? They're fries. Bennigan's. That's tacky. it's incorrect\n","2. Staff: \n","I've had many friends work here. While shift meeting was going on outside (for. That's why you're expanding...like, everywhere. No apologies. The burger I had was pretty good. Partly due to the noise. The design aesthetic of the place was almost really great. I can do just fine with a burger without bacon on it. There was absolutely no line inside. THIS IS NOT LA or NY. We don't need fake lines to show people that we are cool. Sorry bud... Not doing it. All you other suckers have fun waiting in that line. Pretty average burger. Good burgers, but not great! I'm not sold on Hopdoddy the way everyone else seems to be. But I'll have to report back on this one. I like a good smoke on my burger patty which this was lacking. I might go back to Hopdoddy, might not, but leaning more towards not. Boy has this place gone downhill. I told the young woman assigning us a table number we would like a booth. Over priced burgers and fries. Not to mention the ridiculous wait times. My friend brought his kid and first thing I noticed was they didn't have a kids menu. Got a beer and ordered my burger medium rare to rare. Mmmm.....hmmm. However, I was underwhelmed by my burger. If a place is a burger bar, I want the real thing to be the best thing on the menu. I'd be willing to come back, but I'd probably get something other than a regular burger. Read the reviews for this place...have to say I was disappointed. Fries were ordinary and service could have been better given there was no crowd. Recently got the Diablo burger with green chile Queso fries that were great. That's just science). The gluten free bun was burnt on one side. If I hadn't had good experiences before they would have merited one star last night. Pretty much the exact same as the south location. For me the place is just OK. It's just a burger. Hard to feel like I wasn't drinking diet soda. Waiting in line for a burger? So not working! It's not cheap but not expensive either. Is it good? Not in a good way either. Would I go back? Kind of like Starbucks not the best coffee but good marketing/pr department. That being said, there are other things that make a restaurant good besides the food. Also, I don't need him/her to tell me when or if there is a spot available at the bar to sit. And the bartenders are usually very nice (as a the drinks). Fresh hatch chiles on it make it oh-so-good. Was I supposed to tip? So, in summary, great burgers, but total absence of efficiency. Its like the Emperor's New Clothes. It was fine - but not great. Getting around inside here was complicated as was getting refills on drinks. The burger was fine but - pricey. That seems awful steep. Your food comes. Hopdoddy made me hopping mad, I will never eat at this sorry excuse for a \"burger bar\" again. clearly, she doesn't get it. well, i mean she *got* it, she just didn't get all the hype. but what do you expect from someone who goes there and orders a salad? Then, I tried the Prime Time. Truffle!?!?! The wait wasn't that long. I'll be eating here again and I can update my review if I need to. The shake was the best part of the meal. Worth waiting for. And waited. But for the taste, the wait, and the price? It's frustrating enough to make us unlikely to even considering ordering for curbside pick up. The servers never touch these signs. I felt like I just got robbed. So, I am out $50.00 and wondering what the hell Chuck, Guy and the two Larrys are doing. Never again. More on that later. Inside the line itself is a freaking mess. Hopdoddy is no doubt overrated. You have fries, chili cheese fries, and salads. OK, the nitty gritty. The bar is nicely placed, and you can get expedited food there. Boom, roasted. You want fancy stuff in your salad? It was heavily seasoned with... chili seasoning. You Anderson Ln. In the end, I could not see the hype behind Hopdoddy's burgers. Come on man! Beautiful, pink tuna, sprouts, ginger, mayo. Hopdoddy, I do appreciate the quality ingredients used in your adult beverages. Not all its \"Hopped\" up to be. We finally made it there on a rainy day right after they opened and there was still a line. Not that the pesto sauce was bad, just didn't fit into the burger. Absolutely delicious. I simple no not get the crowds. Buns got soggy in about two minutes. They have great quality ingredients and their drinks are superb. As in, dripping wet. I ordered the Joplin burger which sounded like it would be great. My boyfriend's Goodnight burger was ok, a little bland and not memorable. Juices were all over the plate and not in his mouth. Hungry, and Angry= Hangry. Don't go Hangry . The server was great though. Overall, I wouldn't come back despite the tasty burgers. Gourmet burgers are the deal and they are in. I don't understand these overly pretensious  poor service phenomenon restaurants in Austin. Eye rolls, abrasive hostess, screwed up order. That said, the veggie burger was good, hemp seed based, and unlike most others in Austin. First thing parking is bad and if I say bad, very bad. If you want a real burger, made to order go to NXNW avoid the wait and get their fry. I hang up and attempt order without that product. That's why they get 2 stars. The entire experience took almost an hour. Just don't get it. I tried the poblano and the shrom burger. They were juicy but did not leak all over the bun which is a bonus. Avoid the Anderson Lane Hopdoddy! The burgers that weren't mediocre, made me want to throw up. Literally, couldn't finish my entire meal. Gotta say Five Guys and Mighty Fine and even Terra Burger is better than this place. P.S Fries were Ok and shakes were good. We picked up the to-go order and brought it to the office to eat. I really don't understand why people are so in love with this place. The food definitely isn't worth the wait if you go when there is a wait, which of course I did. Still not impressed and still frustrated by this joint's inconvenience. They were neither great or bad . Easy on the modifications please!\" .... If I'm paying you $12 for a burger, I'm going to order it however the fuck I want. There's a good reason there's a roll of paper towels on each table. Sloggy caramalized onion. Atmosphere is terrible, too. Everyone can win. They are really selling themselves short on profits too. Then they expect you to tip the guy who checks you out. More profit loss. Ridiculous! I had a client RAVE about this place for months. However, it's better than ordering food and then not having a place to sit. I had a turkey burger. My husband had the bacon burger. It was literally fries that came out with a side of queso. The food was just okay. The system was confusing. The ordering system is ridiculous. Definitely would come back here for sides, milkshakes and drinks... but not for my mains. I really wanted to love this place. It just wasn't great. It rhymes with Schmize Buys. My date also didn't like his burger, but his was cooked properly. Classics were still partially raw, we didn't eat all of it. Don't get me wrong, I love a good juicy burger that gets on your hands, but this was beyond that. Dispute his appearance, our server was mediocre at best. This was incredibly offensive and if we hadn't been starving we would have left. I might add that the dog only barked at us a couple times as we approached before we even sat. She made a special trip to come talk to us. I will say his decision to ask us to move greatly  effected his tip. Once we got off work him and the yappy dog lady left together. Had we not been so rudely asked to move, I would have rated them higher. It seemed everyone else that worked there except our waiter was very nice. It's good but nowhere that good. Well, its popularity obviously is part of the issue but the other is their bizarre ordering system. But the problem I have with this is Hopdoddy isn't your typical burger joint. It's a restaurant and therefore should be operated like one. What about the food? The burgers, they are good. But they aren't great. This alone, could be reason enough to put up with lines and wet burgers. Freezing weather outside, well, plan on staying on  line outside for at least 15 mins. with the Texan standard burger I've come to expect. Worse, to me, is the lack of sides. Really, I've been happy with my lunches here, but I've enjoyed tastier burgers at fast food joints. Sad cow eyes.... I do not get what all the hype is with this place. The turkey patty seems as if it were pureed, and I did not get a \"Burger\" taste when I ate it. For a third of the price for these. I'll stick with Burger Tex and Hat Creek for my Turkey Burgers. Isn't barbecue sauce usually thick-ish? What's the fuss all about. Super disappointed. The service was terrible. There were two lines to get in and it was very strange process for ordering. The staff would not let me go into the second line to order until my friends arrived. This would have been ok except for one thing:\n","\n","The food was as \"meh\" as it gets. If they can work on the food and cut that price a little I would consider coming back. We went when the place was virtually empty, so lots of attention. It didn't have a long wait time either. They add coconut milk to it which clashed with the Oreo flavor. It felt more like pushing around cattle than gently guiding them to the proper place to order. I am not a fan of the Twisted Root sodas either. See photos attached of me \"rare\" burger and my heaping load of fries. It SHOULD NOT even be called ginger lemonade anymore!!! I don't mind waiting in line for a good burger. I couldn't conceive of a more complicated and ridiculous system if I tried. i wander around and no employees attempt to be helpful. They tell me they will bring it later. so, the burger. So, to sum it up. Not impressed. Probably won't return. Worst curbside service ever. Makes no sense My review is biased. I hate, hate, hate waiting in line for food. Their burgers are good, but not wait-30-minutes good. Thus, Hopdoddy's is quite frankly not worth the trouble. The gin drink with cherries is awesome. The fries are awesome. I don't even mind the line that much. Its uninviting and not sterile. No fries included. Meh on Hopdoddy. Won't be going back. But thatnks for that experience. The fries were very flavorful and the milkshake my boyfriend and I shared was also very tasty. Replace cheese, mayo, and pesto with some vegan sauce. My review of the SoCo location applies here:\n","\n","\"I keep going back. I've had te vegetarian and sushi burger. It's usually really busy. Very good, in fact. It's burgers. place my order and THEN have a waitress come and ask me \"can I get you anything else?\" while I wait some more for my food, I wonder why I come here. Still, I just don't get Hopdoddy. We just don't get it. Unfortunately, I think it's way overhyped. The topping options seem to be done more for attention/novelty than for actual taste. The burger was cooked incorrectly and was barely passable as warm. The batch of fries that we got were starting to go stale and were cold. I just wish that I could have gotten THAT version of this burger bar. No hint of truffle, old oil, crappy Parmesan, and lacking crisp. I realized what the mistake was. I can't get mad at Hopdoddy for the group in front of us allowing their friends to cut. But this was such an annoying experience that I don't think I'll go back. I want Sweet-N-Low for my iced tea, Stevia is bitter. Also, your sign asking me to chillax on the substitutions, really? This place is for you, have fun. When we walked inside we then discovered the 2nd line. The kids shared a classic burger and fries and both enjoyed it without complaint. So overall, a decent burger but nothing exceptional. The flavor of the meat could be better - it wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. The service was AMAZING! She asked if we would want the fries our first and we said why not! I had the primetime and it was meh. My first bite had deep pink in it. This was moist in almost a bad way. Seems like good burgersense to me. Much rather go to Big Daddys or Fudds ! I had the Terlengua, the wife had the Goodnight. I am spoiled to making burgers myself so I was not blown away by the food. My complaints really come from two places - the service and the atmosphere. The service was quick and everything but she was insanely overbearing. This place is Def over-hyped, but worth a stop if you have never experienced it. So what if it's a good burger, it's nothing to write home about. The staff is rude and the neighborhood is nothing special. The beef and pork belly tasted superb but I didn't really feel the Korean qualities of the burger. The kimchi was not the regular red kimchi but rather it looked/tasted like regular pickled cabbage. There was no spice to the so called \"kimchi\" whatsoever. One bite, and nothing but cold pink lamb. Seems weird you're asking this now. Nice folks abound. A pint glass would do the job. Still.... it is just okay burger. Yesterday I closed my bank account, so I don't have a debit card. While the food is good, this a hipster burger joint with hipster values of customer service. Bye Tuna burger- it was good while it lasted. I hadn't heard about this place, but my friend said it was THE new burger place in town. We went on a Saturday evening around 6:30. After getting that we continued on in line to the counter to order. They didn't mind. The problem, however, was that it arrived at our table ice cold. He had to send it back. They were, however, more than accommodating and took it back and made another. They're better than Mighty Fine's, to me, simply because they're bigger. They could still stand to be a bit larger, though. Overall, this place is just ok. The burgers and fries are twice as good at half the price at P. Terry's. I am a big fan of the hopdoddy on SoCo. I am hoping this is an initial 'training error' - and that it gets resolved at some point. A pint of craft beer is $7 to $8. Rediculous. Note: I don't recommend the Hoss Hot Chicken - rather flavorless. That's smart thinking. Never gets old hearing about it even though Austin's been promoting that lifestyle for a good bit. Still the beef to bun ratio was a bit overly slanted towards beef. I requested my burger \"Pink\". There's potential at this location. Totally overrated avreg burger for  $9 with no sides. After about 20 mins of waiting I decided no one was coming and just refilled our drinks myself. If comes with fritos and chili. Whats not to like about that? A very large thick hamburger patty cooked to about 122 degrees. There was no pickle, no salt, no pepper, no ketchup, no mustard, no mayo. The line and ordering system is strange but effective. Wear comfortable shoes. I will stick to Mighty Fine, Phils Ice House and Five Guys. The location in south Austin was marginally better in that I got an OK burger. Horribly salty truffle fries. Nonetheless, the food was good. The burgers were bland and greasy. It was like eating a wet hockey puck, yumm delicious! Hopdoddy has an excellent selection of burgers, maybe the best in town. They will kick you out at closing even if your food was just served 5 minutes ago. The buzz about this place is people are lined up outside so it has to be good. Been to Hopdoddy in Dallas, but this is the first time in Austin. But the food really is heavenly. Even if it was good it isn't worth that price. But for the way I was treated I won't even be back for that! I believe that service is an absolutely crucial part in an business. This is beyond a disappointment. I was not even close to the Asian gentleman and still they continued to judge and be racial. More Austinite Emperor's New Clothes. I ordered a Fiesta Burger. Seasonal Item. Got here around eight. Over and out. Makes you feel warm and fuzzy all over, doesn't it? OMFG - SRSLY? Needless to say a little disappointing, but still phenomenal. Fries are phenomenal and second only to Cover 3. Let's chance it.\" You know the one: it is located right between the bar and the high tables. My milkshake, salty and carmelly and rich! This happens to me every time I eat a burger at Hopdoddy's though maybe it is my technique? I only saw a waiter once and never again, so they aren't really there to help you out. They finally brought a replacement burger for us 20 minutes later! ( Now total wait was 1 hr since we were in line). and the Shake was correct but Freaking PRETZELS (Gluten!)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QJGoo8zLnFPH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636445169523,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":120492,"user":{"displayName":"Lennon Zheng","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi8aZKKVFFQTkerwBjXSGPREF3FSyKY3Kf4cYk_iw=s64","userId":"15127009393047488604"}},"outputId":"67cdd451-1e6d-48f2-c9d6-e6b797d1a659"},"source":["bert_summary_good = ''.join(bert_model(goodRev, min_length=10, max_length=100))\n","print(bert_summary_good)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Very wide range of burger choice! I did switch a couple things out but the brie is lovely! Next: the service. It's delicious food and a great atmosphere! Nice to see such effort on local, quality and such. The water is filtered, the soda offered is of a higher quality than average. They offer indoor and outdoor seating with high and low table options. Easy to park at this location. Clean interior. 2 Things to note:\n","1. So delicious, cooked just the way I like, flavortown all the way. It exploded with flavor in my mouth before I even got the first bite off the burger!! Parmesan Fries-- awesome! We also got 2 shakes; the Oreo tasted like a mint-y Oreo. Everyone we encountered for service was soo nice. We can't wait to come back. The Parmesan truffle aioli fries are SO good too. If you go to the Anderson location, they've give you a big metal bowl for your fries, which I love. Sometimes you can just head straight to the bar instead of waiting in line though! You can't miss with Hopdoddy! We haven't tried them; however, with Hopdoddy's standards, I'm sure they are tasty, too. Be sure to stop by Hopdoddy. You won't be disappointed! This was my first time trying this place and I am amazed at the quality of this burger. Hopdoddy is my favorite burger in Austin and this location is no different! Cannot stress this enough - give Hopdoddy a try and I don't think you'll regret you did! The burger was on the smaller side but honestly was just the perfect serving. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. I came here on a Sunday after church. The chili tasted homemade; it could have used some red pepper, but otherwise was delicious. I will return. It was also quite large which was nice. It's long for a reason. If you want a shorter wait, settle for a lesser burger. Parking on congress can be tricky but that's life in Austin! There is always a wait but goodness this place is SO worth it!!! This is a must stop when I am in Austin and I haven't ever been disappointed. Also the cervecarita is delicious! Had a good buzz after finishing one of those HA! Best burgers in town. Exceptional and friendly service every time, seriously, Greg and the others, thumbs up. This, my friends, was a burger like no other. Bonuses are that Hopdoddy supports locals farmers and producers - a concept I love! The burgers are just outstanding and their truffle fries are just awesome. No way around it. Lots of deliciousness here. Great service fantastic bartenders awesome food!! I'll keep this quite simple:\n","\n","1. Clean and inviting atmosphere\n","4. I've had every burger and I still want everyone of those bad boys. It's like trying to pick a favorite album. Just shut up and go to Hopdoddy. It's worth it. Tl;dr: Hopdoddy burgers rule. The nice thing about the North location is that you can drink outside. It's changed drastically since I first started going. You WILL have to wait in line. .. The truffle fries are also really good. Sometimes they come out with samples of truffle fries. So finish eating and leave and a table opens up. Overall, a trendy place to come grab a burger. The fries are cute and fried daily and are the only fried item in the fryer. This is my favorite type of burger place. There was free water to accommodate and even fries to sample. Talk about efficiency! I was just so happy leaving the place. I had the Llano Pablono burger with Akishi beef. One of the best burgers I've ever had, especially at a restaurant. We sat on the patio for the great weather. I ordered the Goodnight while I was there and it was absolutely delicious! Best service ever! We order immediately. Great atmosphere, get song playlist. In the winter they have heaters so you are comfortable standing in the outside line. We both loved our burgers. This place is amazing! Bottoms up! Patience is key here ladies & gents. --Matthew McConaughey Burger. We waited in line a long time. I ordered the Primetime. And it was GLORY. Dinner was capped off with a shake-a Nutella shake. Medium rare. A place not to miss in Austin! The food here is phenomenal. Would recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger (or veggie burger!). Hopdoddy is a favorite of mine. The people who work there are efficient and friendly and the food is always perfect. I also like to dump some queso on my burger... but that's just me. Easily the best Burger I've ever had. Food: this time I had the Greek burger. So so delicious and refreshing with that burger. Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Austin! It's absolutely amazing. Who can say no to brie?! servers will go through the line so you can sample fries and you can also order drinks. when i first ordered them, i was disappointed. but once i tried it, is was sold. skip the hatch chile version too. salted caramel is the best flavor i've tried. i haven't tried that yet, but a nice option if you don't want to wait in the line. Best burger I've had in a while!! The one other thing I will say about this place is its loaded with hipsters. Do not go when you're extremely hungry. Omg, burgers are amazing. Burgers were very juicy and cooked to perfection plus spiced right. Portions are good and price is also very reasonable. They opened another location in San Antonio, which we will visit for sure. I don't know what all the hype is about this place. I will eventually go again and give an update. On top of great food, their shakes are awesome. Just writing this review makes me want to go there and have another Nutella-Pretzel shake! I highly recommend this place. It's a black bean/corn patty with lots of delicious original HopDoddy fixins! I'll be visiting again. This place came highly recommended as a must try. Try this place and tell me that again! I know, I know... you're too full to get a shake after the size of that burger. BRAVO, One of the BEST in TOWN! Like everyone else, I have placed a lot of \"to go\" orders in the past 9 months. Thursday night, I placed a large order of burgers and fries, curbside pickup. Great fries too, chipotle ketchup is the bomb. The menu is not too big but it has quite a bit of variety. Love how they recycle and use produce from local farmers. But I'll be back during the lunch time hour! I do like that this location is much shorter than the south congress one. What I love about Hopdoddy Burger Bar:\n","\n","1. But worth it when you waltz right up to place your order. They've got the \"Lil' Prick\" here. ( It's a sassy Pear Martini. Basically this review is just like my review of the original SoCo location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. While I've been to the original SoCo location many times they were nice to tell you the routine. Each was sooo good). When everyone is happy it makes me happy so this will be a place we will visit again in Austin. Stop picking on the new guy, y'all. Maybe even more pleased since there is a smaller line by design which means less waiting time. But ordering and seat finding is all the same. Burger quality is the same. Recommend the Bourbon burger for me and Ahi Tina for my wife. Burger was cooked medium-well. The fries everyone raves about are good, not great. First off, let me say that I am not a fan of burgers. Honestly, that burger is equivalent to two small meals for me haha. But if you come late at night (like 10pm ish), there is no wait at all. Then Hopdoddy's is your place! I have tried several of their burgers and the Primetime is my absolute favorite. However, it's a new day at Hopdoddy! Thank you, Hopdoddy. Primetime is our regular. Again, amazing. This is one of my favorite places in Austin and definitely my most frequented. Seriously, all of them are good! First time to Austin and I ate here tonight. Classic burger - Amazing! I would say this is the best burger I ever ate. It's a must! You pass the bar on your way to order. The cashier was quick and read back the order. Despite being a large burger, it was not greasy at all. P.S. Somehow I made it through to revisit Hopdaddys again.. Yay! I don't get enough. Like a dummy. Are you thirsty? I can't say no to Hopdoddy. That burger was TALL. She wasn't kidding. It's still possible to eat, you just have to smush it a bit. The fries are oh so yummy in my tummy. Nutella pretzel milk shake. I love this Hopdoddy environment. It's an open area that's not too crowded. I love both Hopdoddy locations tho don't get me wrong. I recommend the ahi tuna burger. New business idea???) All in all I'd come back! Whoa momma. Great choices, but it is time you stepped into the light, and tried the best burger on their menu. The Ahi Tuna Burger. I couldn't recommend it more. I was actually craving a gyro, so when I saw the Greek burger I figured, why not? Sadly it was the best \"gyro\" I've found since moving to the area. This place has amazing burgers. It's delicious. Truffle fries are also amazing. I could drink the chile and die happy. The service is always great and the servers are always so friendly and down to earth. This is the best burger joint in Austin. The truffle fries here are great as well, i just wish they weren't so tiny. Sacramento, CA). Loved the artwork on the walls of musicians and the employees had a cool vibe. Hopdoddy has got it going on. The food is obviously great. I called the manager on tonight, Michael to explain the issue. YOU EVEN GET TO ORDER DRINKS DURING THIS PROCESS. Get over it, whiners. That being said, the Primetime blew. Meaty, moist, everything you could want if you're craving a burger. The GF bun gets a little soggier than the standard but I have no problem eating it with a fork. Why the Ahi tuna burger? They are almost always packed but don't let that scare you off. But really you can't go wrong. PRO TIP: Get them to char the outside on a medium burger. My personal \"beef\" (hah!) with Hopdoddy are their small fries. Sorry Hopdoddy, I still love you! We had the fries with queso and they were amazing. I wish we  had one of these in Houston. I fell in love with Hopdoddy from their SoCo location. The aoili is outstanding. Enjoy folks. Everything was so fresh and straight out of the heat. The Llano Poblano Burger. El Diablo Burger. My go to burger currently is the Diablo. Very refreshing to know in this day and age of chain restaurants. Tall, lanky, and lacking grace.. party of one? Only a sip or two escaped, but onto the poor guy and I felt awful. He was cool about it though and didn't make me feel like an idiot which was sweet. Can't take me nowhere I tell you. The bun was soft and warm and the patty cooked to perfection. They look legit! The salted caramel and vanilla bean ones especially caught me eye. However, Hopdoddy does a wonderful job of making your wait as painless as possible. They were handing out free margarita samples to people in line. You can order beer while on line...  Enough said. I stopped in to eat on May 4th and they had a long line which made for a long wait. try it out. I'm not quite sure I even know how to accurately describe it. Their GF buns are phenomenal!!! I'm going to be craving this burger again in the days to come and I cannot wait to go back! Is there a Hopdoddy punchcard??? I just love this place. You can preorder drinks in line outside. The fact that they have the option available is great. Do they really need another 5 star review? Today was the day. The Llano P. is good but the El Diablo is just better to us. We went there last night for our first to-go order (didn't call ahead). All for a TO-GO order! I don't eat meat often, but when I do - Hop Doddy will be at the top of the list! One of the best burger places I've been too. Actually just everything about it feels luxurious, but in a chill and comfortable casual way. And now I have made myself hungry (again). Positives:\n","-Got a beer at the bar. The bartender went out of his way to make recommendations and talk with us while we were waiting. The waitress also checked in our our table several times to make sure we were set on drinks. Everyone was very attentive. After realizing that they don't have gluten free options, I was force to order food with gluten. OH LAWD SWEET BABY JEZUS....it was a party in my mouth...simply divine. The burgers are amazing. There seems to always be a line but it moves pretty fast. . . . I'm willing to stand in line with 4 children under 6 years old so it's not that bad. :) Gets very packed so not a good place to go if just looking for a quick burger fix. Always looking forward to trying the next best thing. Nothing but praises for El Diablo. Partly bc of mixed reviews from friends but mainly because I never wanted to wait in line to eat. I ordered the Tuna burger with fries and the bloody Mary. Not sure if that was done intentionally but it worked out well. The real star of Texas burger chains is Hop Doddy. Seriously nothing comes close! I love a good burger. I eat one just about every day. Ive been here at least 10 times and I've never been disappointed.... Never. The Ahi Tuna burger was strange but amazing... Like eating a sushi burger. I would highly recommend it for the Hopdoddy fan who wants to try something a bit different! Just have to say that you will not be disappointed with a visit to Hopdoddy's. Service: friendly service. The El Diablo is on the spicy side as it includes peppers. Good place to take family or friends. Overall: COME GET A BURGER FROM HOPDODDY'S! We waited in line for about 30 minutes but once I bit into my burger I knew why. Amazing food, service and good beer selection. The lines were crazy but we got right in at the bar. I loved it! Service was exceptional, they checked on us several times. Love this place! Each one is so unique and has its own personality. We also shared the truffle fries and got a lemon olive oil biscotti milk shake. I loved the lamb burger in the Greek and the pickled onions that came on it. The fries were golden brown, perfectly cut, and had lots of parmeson. Tip: go at an off hour unless you like waiting in lines ( I don't.) Fluoride-free reverse osmosis water???? Fried chicken sandwich. Everything tasted to fresh and great. So cheesy and garlicky and crisp. as for burgers, I had the prime time and wow! Make sure you try the chipotle ketchup! If you don't, you will probably regret it for the rest of your life. I typically avoid burger joints, I prefer other styles of food by far - but this place...OMG! But now I'm hooked. The burger was great! Fries excellent. Environment good...comfortable with music and they have a bar area for those interested. Easily the best veggie burger I've ever had and a must stop each time I'm in town. I can see this becoming a weekly habit. That can't be right. Even my meat lover husband was very impressed when he tasted my veggie burger. I recommend this burger to all those who are first timers at Hopdoddy! My favorite burger bar in Texas so far. Thankfully they were giving out truffle fry samples... Just made me drool even more though. Got the ahi tuna burger and it was literally perfection. Great bar drinks too! The gluten free bread is arguably one of the best GF buns I've ever eaten. So I was worried that the Anderson Ln showing wouldn't be strong. Folks, it was awesome! Repeat after me...soft ingredients go on underneath of the meat patty. If you have kids, delegate! I also tried the ahi tuna burger, but that burger wasn't tasty compared to the burgers with meat. If you're not a heavy eater, then one burger is enough to share between two people. This place is a must do if you ever find yourself in Austin.......\n","\n","Great Job!!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fgFGkdvbrfGK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636447539280,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6585,"user":{"displayName":"Lennon Zheng","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi8aZKKVFFQTkerwBjXSGPREF3FSyKY3Kf4cYk_iw=s64","userId":"15127009393047488604"}},"outputId":"4cef286b-efc8-4629-a66e-66fa8ee3829f"},"source":["bert_sum_good_sum = ''.join(bert_model(bert_summary_good, min_length=20, max_length=50))\n","print(bert_sum_good_sum)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Very wide range of burger choice!
