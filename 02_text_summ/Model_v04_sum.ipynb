delicious, especially their Mac and cheese! I wish there were more combo options in smaller and cheaper amounts instead of family deals for $99. Service was great and the BBQ was superb One of my favorite BBQ places in town. The meats and the sides are both fantastic, it doesn\\'t smell like your table is located inside the smoker, and the noise level is manageable. Highly recommended. Outstanding! You can say I\\'m a bit of a snob when it comes to BBQ as I previously worked at a BBQ spot but I gotta say, this place definitely hit the spot. \\n\\nThe atmosphere felt welcoming and the employees were all very helpful, I think my favorite part was the beer station or the fact that you could literally pop open a beer while in line and then order cafeteria style. Once you choose your sides, you then choose your meats and then you are ready to go from there. Little on the pricy side of things but cmon, it\\'s BBQ you pay for that GOOD STUFF :) BBQ was lefit asf! Be prepared for a bit of a wait, but it\\'s totally worth it. The meat was juicy, had good bark and extremely flavorful. Mmmm smoke . A bit pricy, but then again, you get what you pay for. Definitely with the experience. Sides were also pretty good. I had the beef rib and my girlfriend had brisket, all delicious. Our group of 6 came in on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30pm. When we got there, we started our wait on the line outside. How this place works is that you order your sides then move to the station where the they cut the meats while you pay for the food. We waited about 30 minutes before we got to order. \\n\\nFor sides, we ordered the Potato Salad, Mac-N-Cheese, Green Beans and Banana Pudding. For the meats, we ordered the Brisket and Beef Rib. They price the meats by the pound. I wasn\\'t aware of how many pounds we ordered of each item, but what you see in the picture was PLENTY for the 6 of us. I rarely eat meat but saw so many great reviews, I just had to try it. The meats were juicy, tender and the best part were the rubs/spices they used. Each of the sides paired well in their own way.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting in line, we were worried that it would be impossible to find seating once we paid for the food. The restaurant filters out pretty quickly and we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table to open up. We came for lunch (around 11:30am), and there was almost no wait. The line moves very quickly and we were able to order almost immediately. \\n\\nWe had heard that Terry Black\\'s is one of the best in Austin, so we decided to give it a try. The jalapeño cheese sausage was super good, but the brisket was average (compared to Franklin). The mac and cheese was also delicious. The sauces were great too!\\n\\nThe place was huge so there was more than enough seating. All in all, we had a pretty great experience here. Our go to spot especially when we have guests in town that we want to introduce to world famous Austin BBQ Amazing and great night out. Great atmosphere and amazing brisket and sausage! Family went here for the holidays and were very pleased with people food and service. Will definitely be back! After moving away from Lockhart, I truly missed Black\\'s BBQ. SO glad the family had a location in Austin now. Always pretty busy, so best to go in the off-hours. I especially love their Jalapeno-cheese sausage, cream corn, & their beans. Oh gosh...those beans! I always get a pint of them. My sweetie and I took a Sunday drive up to Austin. We both were in the mood for some good barbecue. I looked up a few places on Yelp and saw many people raved about Terry Black\\'s, so we decided to try it out. I will say this much we stood in line for about 30-35 minutes but it was well worth the wait. The beef ribs were to die for and I\\'m a very picky eater. My sweetie ordered brisket, sausage, potato salad and Mac & cheese.  It was all delicious. We will definitely be back. There was even enough for leftovers. My buddies and I just got all the meats. All the meats. All of them. We were just causally passing things back and forth to get a solid experience of what this place has in a totally casual, platonic way. Emotions were high.\\n\\nTastebuds explosions ensues...\\n\\nAt some point we realized we were eating off of the trays at the tables next to us. The only bad thing we had was what we thought was a pork rib, but it turned out to be a lady\\'s finger at the next table.\\n\\nExcellent BBQ, but the sides sucked, so only 4/5 from me. This BBQ was great. Coming from a BBQ family I was still very surprised. The brisket was my favorite. So Flavor full and tender. This was me at my most slovenly in Austin. Okay the wait was only about 20 minutes on a Wednesday (take that, Franklin) to get up to the self-serve sides window and about 40 minutes to get to the cash register. We couldn\\'t really decide and we knew we weren\\'t gonna be having this level of bbq for awhile, so we went all out. Sides: pinto beans, potato salad, corn bread, mac and cheese. Dessert: peach cobbler and banana pudding. Meats: brisket, sausage, ribs and pulled pork. I can\\'t compare this to Franklin. Franklin was so good and such a perfect experience, organized and well-executed. But for 20% of the waiting time, Terry Black\\'s is pretty freaking great. I think the brisket was better at Franklin. But you won\\'t be disappointed by TBs! If I have a pic of our slop trays (oink oink), I\\'ll post it! I also had a nice local sour ale in a can. Loved how many choices there were for microbrews, on ice. Beyond amazing. Most definitely a place to go to if you\\'re in town visiting or if you\\'re local! Took my cousin who was in town visiting for Christmas and she went all the way with the single bone in rib, brisket, and sausage. Would highly recommend any cut that they have and in small amounts, if you\\'re on your own or ordering individually so that you can try a bit of everything. While you\\'re there, you\\'ve gotta try the sides. Every single side is worth it and I honestly wish I had gotten more, but they are a bit expensive. Can\\'t wait to come back! One of my favorite BBQ spots for beef ribs in Austin. The meat on the beef ribs almost falls of the bone and are quite flavor-able. I love the sides of corn, and mac&cheese. The cobbler is above average as it is sweet and warm. The customer service was great. The line can be long at times. Wow this was so good. Brisket and jalapeño/cheese sausage was so good. The sides were spot on too. Of course I\\'d heard the hype about this place but it\\'s well deserved. I was told to go early and did. It was quick and delicious. I\\'ll go back. I really love this place. I use them for large bulk catering orders and they\\'re always on time, helpful, and easy to order from. Who doesn\\'t love good BBQ? Coma BBQ food! From the sides to the main meats! The line is obviously long if you go at a busy time. I recommend going right before your hungry that way by the time you get through the line.\\n\\nI always ask for the ends of the brisket because I love it a little burnt. BUT the brisket is incredible.\\n\\nThe cornbread is so good as well! \\nI always get the Mac and cheese too! As a tourist of Austin, we ended up here because the a few local Uber drivers said it was a solid choice for Texas barbeque without the long wait and hassle. I\\'m glad I listened...just looking at the parking lot of trucks, it seemed like a solid place for locals and tourists. It\\'s set up like a cafeteria where you can scoop your own sides and then you head to the butcher for the delicious meats. From the massive beef rib to the creamed corn to their peach cobbler were all great. I was addicted to their Spanish rice and the pecan pie. Excellent food and lines move fast.  I would say their customer service of their staff detracts from overall experience. Great BarBQ! Wait was minimal and landing is Austin, we wanted some food quick! After eating BarBQ all over, I would give a big Dannnng come hungry. This place was amazing. We were confused by the ordering system at first but our slicer? (I think her name was Frances but that could\\'ve been the cashier\\'s name) was so helpful. She explained how you just order by the slice/pieces of ribs/links of sausage and they just weigh it and it\\'s priced by the pound. The turkey was probably my favorite followed by the pork ribs. She gave us a sample of the sausages too which was really nice. You can grab slices of bread and picked if you wanna make a sandwich out of your meats. \\n\\nGot mac&cheese and green beans as sides. Did not disappoint.\\n\\nThere were a few types of bbq sauce but sweet was my favorite. Kinda tangy. \\n\\nAlso like how they have a selection of beers in a cooler that you can browse and grab. \\n\\nDefinitely would go back. This place was so good!  Best BBQ ever.  We ordered all the variety of meats on the menu and had left overs for 2 of us.  Half a lb of everything, 1 beef rib and 4 baby back ribs.    Both of use didn\\'t care for the sausages.  That was the only miss for us in the meat department.  The sides were okay - we had the peach cobbler, cole slaw (sweet) and green beans (too soft).  I would get the smallest portion of the sides if you must try it.  The line went by really fast at 11:30 am and we ordered beers at the half way mark and continued to wait in the line to order the food.  Great experience! Do yourself the favor and stop here! Everything was great!!!\\n\\nSo many options of sides but I ended up getting the Mac and cheese, creamed corn (amazing), potato salad and some cornbread \\n\\nThe cornbread I will skip next time \\n\\nI also got the brisket and wow it was delicious so so delicious \\n\\nJalapeño cheddar sausage was amazing also. \\n\\nThank you for the amazing food I never expected Austin to have such great BBQ. Then again, it is a part of Texas.  It was expensive but realllllyyyy good and made amazingly. I loved it. The atmosphere at this place is also great and the staff are A1. I\\'ve never had Texas BBQ before so this might be a little biased. But lord, the brisket was good. So much flavor in such soft meat. I mean the other meat was good too, the ribs the sausage, but the brisket won it all. It was juicy and succulent, definitely filling as well. The unlimited sides in a set price container was also a great addition. The green beans were a great complement and palette cleanser to the meat. The Mac and cheese was a bit watery and not creamy enough. I wish I had gotten more green beans! \\n\\nOverall a great experience. Left me very full and happy! The OG will always be the best. The Dallas location cannot compare. This place is fantastic. The beef rib is sooo big and delicious, one rib is about 2-3 pounds, brisket is so soft and tender, but not as moist as rudy\\'s. I like both. They are both different. The links are good. All the sides I\\'ve tried has been great. I love the mac and cheese and green beans, The potato salad is good, Corn is okay, it has a very cinnamon taste to it, kinda too sweet to me. Overall A+ It was my first time trying this place and really enjoyed it! I had the brisket sandwhich and peach cobbler. They both are good! The sandwiches are big so make sure to leave room for the cobbler! There is a bit of a wait time but as long as you are patient you will really enjoy the place! Food is fresh and limited. A line can build as early as 6pm, leaving you waiting, hoping, and salivating for a piece of their ribs, brisket, and sausage. Absolutely CHANGED my life. I\\'m from CA so I eat avocado toast and salad well never again. I ate at Terry Blacks because well why not. Holy cow!!!!! I LOVED it. I had no idea food could make me SO happy. I can NOT wait to come back A.S.A.P.  everything from the soft white bread, pickles and onions were great but that Mac and cheese and brisket was a game changer for sure!!!!!! This place has great BBQ! There is typically a line but it moves quickly. When you walk in you\\'ll pass a bar and can order drinks for while you wait. You then will order your sides. Once you receive your sides you\\'ll continue you on to the meat and pay. The food was delicious. We ordered Mac and cheese, potato salad, brisket, and jalapeño cheddar sausage. I definitely recommend this spot! Overall, a very good experience. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  The food is very good, but the meats definitely outshine the sides. I walked away convinced that was perhaps the best brisket I\\'ve ever had, and then I realized I couldn\\'t actually recall any of the sides I\\'d eaten. So skimp on the sides and load up on the brisket and sausage! Great BBQ! We had lunch at another Austin BBQ place that will have a separate complementary review but for my money this place was great. \\n\\nWe got there around 4:30 and there were a few people in line ahead of us but it was a short wait. \\n\\nThey had not sold out of anything but I stuck to brisket this time. We had some lean cut and some burnt ends. Burnt ends are not listed on the menu but they get them for you if you ask. \\n\\nThe beef ribs looked amazing - but the one they had out when we went through the line was 1 and  pounds and that\\'s too much for even me to eat. \\n\\nThe creamed corn was tasty but I suggest that you save room for the banana pudding with Nilla Wafers in it. \\n\\nA few people commented that the meat was a bit salty, but I add salt to everything so it was just right for me. This is our go to bbq! Hands down our favorite for food and service. We found this place when we first moved here last year and it remains a staple! We were looking for somewhere to eat that wasn\\'t food trucks and found this spot. This place was amazing! The brisket was a nice lean cut however they offer \"moist\" which is less lean. Ribs were amazing, fall of the bone. Their desserts were also good they had banana pudding and peach cobblers with ice cream. Staff was nice, place was nice and clean. They also had a small souvenir area with wood crafts :) Great experience! This took me all the way OWT. EVERYTHING was amazing. The beef rib was a bit too salty but good!!!! I\\'m sure I can\\'t add anything else that hasn\\'t already been said, but do yourself a favor and eat here. Like, just stop what you\\'re doing, yeah you, staring at your screen, just stop it, and stop being a fool, and go eat some barbeque. Seriously, this place is the bomb and everything that barbeque is suppose to be, but you weren\\'t suppose to read that because you were suppose to go out and be eating barbeque by now.\\n\\n\\nMy only regret is that I had lived in Austin for years, and drove by this location hundreds of times, before I finally stopped in and had my life take on new meaning. If I was on death row and asked for my last meal, I would tell them a 1/2 lb of brisket and macaroni with corn bread from Terry Black\\'s, and then I\\'d also tell the guard to get himself a plate too, and we\\'d enjoy barbeque heaven together, right before he fried me in the chair. If you haven\\'t had Terry Black\\'s, you\\'re wrong. We finally tried this place and the line was long even in Sunday at 2 pm, but it went by quick by enjoying the aroma of BBQ and reading the \"how to order\" signs. We got the brisket and pork ribs. It was a little pricey and the brisket had more salt on it than it needed, but we enjoyed the meal on the outside covered patio. The meat was tender and  smokey like it should be. The meat is all weighed and cost about $18-$20 per pound, so wife and I each got 1/2 lb of pork ribs and 1/2lb of brisket. Each side is $2.00 that you scope up yourself (so make sure you fill up your paper bowl). Craft beers (in self serve bottles) were already out, and were not restocked when we went through the line. Good place to have on your BBQ bucket list when in Austin. First time in Texas and this was a must go according to locals. I had 2 slices of brisket and sausage with green beans & Mac n cheese. Everything was good but it is a lot of food! My best advice would be to order one side with your meat and potluck with your friends. It can be a little pricey, but it was good and the cornbread muffins are great! I would go back, customer service is good too. Solid barbecue spot. Came here on a Monday afternoon and the lines weren\\'t long at all. Got the brisket sandwich, brisket, ribs, mac & cheese, and beans. The sauces were great, the sides were okay, the meat quality was amazing! Californians don\\'t make barbecue like this, and I\\'d definitely come back for more! Dinner was amazing! You order your sides buffet style and then they c. your meat in front of you when you pay. The sides were all delicious--we got 7 of them to share between us. The brisket and sausage were moist and flavorful. We ate outside and there is a porch and a great view of a park across the street. Definitely will be returning! I have never been a fan of BBQ but now I know I was not having the real deal. We were just visiting from California and definitely want to come back. The food was fresh and delicious. We still talk about it. Definitely great food great service. Beef rib is outstanding and definitely a differentiator. Sides are good and the brisket and chicken are both delicious. It is open for dine-in!\\nOur fav bbq in Austin for its consistent taste, service and price!\\n\\nEverytime I go to BBQ place, usually I might like the meat but not the sauce and sides or the other way round. Terry Black\\'s meat are always tender, full of flavour and the sauce is just right my alley. The sides dishes especially the green bean is perfect! Not overcooked but just enough tenderness and crunch.\\n\\nMust order: Moist Brisket, Pork ribs and Original Sausage.\\n\\nAlso, today I really appreciated the small gesture the person in charge of cutting the meat did. We ordered a pound of pork ribs, after giving us 4 ribs, which was only 0.8lb. After that he took out one of the bone of the pork ribs on his cutting board before adding those the rest to our order which make the total weight just right 1lb. This small gesture is what make them awesome. I mean he didn\\'t have to take out the bones and just added the rest but his consideration made me so appreciative. THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST. I spent a week in Austin this summer and are BBQ everyday. We tried all the \"best\" spots in the town. This was number one! Good friendly service, they always have everything! Big smoke house on site. Good pricing, good sauce. Pickle bar, sweet tea, and desserts available.\\nHave already considered flying back for lunch just to get a bite of the jalapeño cheddar sausage again. The BBQ was great! Wait wasn\\'t terrible when we arrived to eat and annoyed the Brisket, sausage and turkey that we ordered. Great brisket, nice and moist and with great flavor! The rub can be a bit salty, but nothing that wouldn\\'t make me go back for more! I went at 5:30pm on a Wednesday night and they still had BBQ! Great brisket & sausage! Highly recommend a visit while you\\'re in Austin! I\\'d recommend both the creamed corn and the cornbread for sides, both were really amazing! Mac and cheese and potato salad are okay but weren\\'t my favorites or really standouts compared to the other two sides. Enjoy! Absolutely amazing and worth the wait...their sides and meat are perfection. We got the ribs and brisket sandwich...sooooo dang good. BBQ was tasty. I had 2 slices of yummy lean brisket.  Potato salad was also yummy. Mac and cheese was cheesy. The cornbread was sweet and a big muffin size. Worth the few minutes in line. You can grab a beer while you wait in line they have alcohol at the entrance. Best BBQ EVER!! Our foodie favs were: Turkey, Beef rib, creamed corn & peach cobbler. Thank you guys If you told me a year ago i\\'d be eating a half pound of ribs, I would\\'ve said \"you crazy\". These days, I could easily eat half a pound of pork ribs, thanks to the moist, delicious and hot bbq by Terry Black\\'s. When did that happen? Best pork bbq ribs, hands down. I think people are too quick to underestimate this place since it\\'s a brick-and-mortar location and they never sell out versus some place you basically have to camp out in line for or are sold as soon as they open. To me, Terry\\'s offers the taste of solid brisket and bbq with unmatched convenience. I just wish they could come up with some in-house baked bread/rolls! Came out to Texas to visit one of my good friends I was in the Air Force with. As far as food goes the one thing I wanted more than anything was to get some really, authentic Texas BBQ. We do a lot of food right in my home state of California but I don\\'t find BBQ to one of them. I\\'d been hearing really good things about Terry Black\\'s so we decided to check it out.We both got the brisket and sausage. Man, I tell you it did not disappoint. That brisket was so tender and juicy it practically melted in my mouth. The sausage was really awesome as well. Thanks a lot, guys,I\\'ll definitely be back Overall my experience was amazing.  I got the brisket and turkey with Mac and cheese and banana pudding as my sides.  The mac and cheese was nice and gooey.  You really can\\'t go wrong with the mac and cheese.  I love banana pudding and I put high expectations on it.  When I took a bite of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I tried a few more bites but couldn\\'t finish it.  I got the moist brisket and it was delicious.  It wasn\\'t salty at all.  I like the meat to speak for itself and it was good.  It had a good bark and juicy.  I feel turkey is not praised a lot but it\\'s a delicious cut of meat.  They probably season it with the same rub as the brisket.  I put a slice of turkey and put it in a slice of bread with some bbq sauce and hot sauce.  When I bit down it was like butter.  The turkey was moist and I could eat it all day. Now this is an AMAZING place if you ever in the mood for the best bbq ever. Hands downs this place is excellent. Their bbq is the best I\\'ve ever had. The only downfall is that the wait, but if you\\'re in no hurry to get anywhere stop here for the bbq. One of the top 50 BBQ joints, for a reason. Food is very good, and line moves incredibly fast. There is plenty of space to sit, and restaurant is located in Barton Sorings so there is a lot going on around.\\nBrisket is moist and perfect amount of bark. Love their green beans, and Ribs are dynomite.\\nAs like all BBQ cost can get expensive, easily can spend $30 on lunch, especially with a beef rib (better have friends help you eat it as it\\'s enormous).\\n\\n**Friends and I are touring all 50 top BBQ and T Blacks is definitely up there. Not the best, but so far it\\'s top 10. For only that reason I give it a 4 Star. Perfection! I have never been to a bbq place that you can peel the brisket bark away from the fat! So tender and juicy! Gosh it was just heaven. The sides are equally as good, mac n cheese perfectly cheesy and the potato salad was well balanced! Overall it\\'s an amazing bbq place and I\\'m picky! \\n\\nService: self service including sides so that\\'s nice because you can portion control! Price is amazing for the quality Shush!  Don\\'t tell anyone outside of Yelp that Terry Black\\'s BBQ is the best in the Austin area.     The brisket and sauces were awesome.  I liked the sweet and the spicy ones.  The potato salad, cream corn, and banana pudding were great.   I can\\'t wait to go back! Terry Black\\'s is a really solid BBQ place in Austin. I frequently find myself taking visitors here because they have parking, ample seating, a manageable line, and the cafeteria style line makes ordering easy for groups. And of course, their BBQ and sides are yummy! I love the creamed corn and the banana pudding. I will say that there are a few places in Austin will better BBQ (Franklin\\'s), but given all of the other good qualities mentioned above, Terry Black\\'s is a really great BBQ option if you don\\'t have time to wait 4 hours for BBQ. I really like Terry Black\\'s. Some of the other local joints are over hyped in my opinion. I have catered Terry Black\\'s for number events. It\\'s always delicious. Meats and sides are both on point. The food was good, I thought it was a bit expensive. One beef ribs cost $36.00. green beans were excellent,the cobbler was very good. My first bbq in Austin, I hope to find better. I have been following Terry Black\\'s on IG for over a year now and always said if I visit Austin, this place was a must go.  I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL... we went on Friday, mid afternoon.  Customers were coming out as we were going in and they were all smiles so we ask about their experience and got rave reviews.  This only heightened my anticipation.  I ordered the beef rib, brisket, and jalapeno cheddar sausage, potato salad and mac n cheese.  Someone else in the group ordered the pork ribs, banana pudding and the brisket sandwhich.  Everything was AMAZING...the meat was sooo tender it literally melted in my mouth... fall of the BONE greatness... I haven\\'t had good BBQ since I\\'ve moved to Texas and when I say this was WORTH every minute of the 3 hour drive.  The employees were friendly and best of all... THEY ARE COMING TO THE DFW area by the end of the year... WINNING... CAN\\'T WAIT !!! Had brisket, spare ribs and sausage.  Cole slaw and baked beans on the side.  The meats were amazing.  Very authentic Texas BBQ.  Side were very tasty.  The only knock I had is that they had no beer on tap, and the bottles were in large trays with ice poured over them which is fine, but they were largely exposed to the room temperature air.  The beer was not as cold as i expected.  I did not deduct any stars for this, as it had very little to do with my overall experience. Ok, did the original location in Lockhart. We\\'re from Georgia so always smoking butts. This is the real deal for brisket,  and that\\'s all I need tio say about that. Potato salad was especially good. Just go,  and I\\'m not wasting anymore words for bbq. You know what I\\'m saying. Loved it found it clean great BBQ Texas style,Staff was friendly and welcoming\\nPlenty of parking, No waiting in line.loved the hot fresh green beans as well as the cole slaw.every thing was fresh and Tender Oh my goodness the Brisket was so moist and I  was able to cut it with a plastic fork.,Cheddar Jalapeno  Sausage with some cornbread and beans .mmm \\nEverything was great.I will be back it was so good I wanted too work there.And I am retired. This barbecue is amazing. We tried a little of everything and I will say their pork ribs are definitely out of the world. This is my favorite Brisket in town. My go-to order is 3/4 lb moist brisket with an avocado, jalapenos, and cheddar cheese. Brisket has been incredibly well prepared every time I have ordered it. The location and ambiance of this restaurant is incredible, with abundant outdoor seating that overlooks the Auditorium Shores at Town Lake. As a native of New England, I readily admit that I\\'m not experienced enough to be a BBQ \"expert,\" but I know when it tastes good. Terry Black\\'s tastes good. \\n\\nI would give the brisket and sausage high marks. I ordered too much based upon how good it looked and still ate almost all of it. I got the lean brisket and could have used a spoon it was so tender. Great bark and great flavor. \\n\\nA friend shared some turkey, which was pretty good, but not as great as the brisket and sausage. I didn\\'t try the ribs. \\n\\nSides were good. I got some Mac & cheese. Nothing earth shaking, but I was there for the brisket. The pecan pie was good, but again, the brisket ruled supreme.\\n\\nNice staff. The gentleman at the register came by when the rush died down and genuinely wanted to make sure that the food was good. \\n\\nOne gripe--no Dr. Pepper? I had a Mexican Coke, but would have loved a nice cold bottle of Dr. Pepper. \\n\\nI will be back in Austin in November, and I will make a return trip to Terry Blacks. Can you say WOW?!? Beef rib, money. Pork rib, money. Creamed corn, money. AND THAT MAC & CHEESE. Best BBQ I\\'ve had. We came and got to order to order away. Seeing the meat and watching them cut your order fresh is such a cool, unique experience. Hands down best ribs I\\'ve ever had in my life! I waited in line maybe 25 min before ordering but as you order they put your food on your plate so not a bad wait at all! All the sides looked good but I only had the Mac and cheese and green beans and they were delicious!! Listen, get the ribs you won\\'t regret it! They were perfect without bbq sauce that\\'s how good they were! The line is long, but with this good of food, it has to be. The set up of ordering is as efficient as they can make it, so a lot of respect there! The Mac n Cheese gives you the nostalgic feeling. The food is good enough to the point where you walk in, thinking what you want to order, and once you see them prepare it right in front of you, you completely change your mind. It was amazing. Highly recommend and worth the wait! Exceptional food.  The brisket was unbelievably good, you can cut it with a plastic fork. I wanted to try Austin BBQ w/o standing in line for an hr. This was very pleasant-nice location across from a big grassy park and easy parking. I got the pork rib which was delicious, the meat fell off the bone. My sides were cole slaw & green beans. I would definitely get those 2 again. I took one star off for the side dish size being small. Thx Austin! When I think of Austin, I think bbq. And this place has the quintessential unctuous fatty meaty perfection you look for in good barbeque. We got the fatty brisket, beef rib, mac and cheese, beans and potato salad. Everything was absolutely delicious and I\\'d recommend this meal to anyone looking for a good meat-heavy meal in the area. De.li.cious.\\n\\nJust like everyone else has written, this barbecue is absolutely amazing- especially for the price point! There may be a line dependent on what time you go but it\\'s definitely worth the wait. It\\'s cafeteria style; you pick up your sides from a buffet line and then your meats at the register before sitting down. They also have raw red onion, pickles, and white bread as complementary sides. Our meal for two people was less than $35 for one pound of brisket, 1/4 pound of sausage, 3 sides (creamed corn, mac & cheese, potato salad), and one piece of cornbread. This was way too much food for my boyfriend and I but we wanted to try as much as we could! Everything was absolutely delicious but of course, the brisket was the star of the show. It was super moist and tender, with a great charred crust. No doubt, a place I would return to! Went as a group of 3 and ordered \\n- 5 slices of brisket\\n- 1 beef rib \\n- 1 jalapeño cheddar sausage link\\n- cornbread \\n\\nAnd it was plenty! It came with free pickles, bread, and onion. Loved the slightly sweet and warm cornbread for $1, and both the brisket and rib. The sausage didn\\'t really taste like jalapeño but it as unique- a little crumbly in texture. Loved both the sweet and original sauces. Awesome customer service all around and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. You get so much for your money.\\nThe brisket literally melts in your mouth and the ribs are great. Just driving by this place will give your nose a delight. All sauces rock! I love that the sides are self serve. Load \\'em up!! The sides are delicious. But the real star is the brisket! Seriously the most tender and the most moist brisket I have ever had. Almost all brisket I have ever had is dry, but not at Black\\'s! Seriously the best brisket. The service is also great. They answered all the questions we had patiently. Great smoked BBQ! Get there before lunch because it gets really crowded! Great atmosphere and they also serve beer! BBQ sauce is not need with your bbq but I tried the original bbq sauce and it was great! I will definitely be back. Prices are decent you get what you pay for! Believe the hype! Recently was my first time at this location and it was honestly an amazing choice I loved the brisket and mac & cheese and definitely recommend everyone to get the spicy barbecue sauce it is also phenomenal. I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere and the customer service as the employees were engaged with us in conversation and helped us make an overall decision I enjoyed this location much better than their rivals in Lockhart. Better lighting, a nice patio, friendlier service, and a mush shorter drive. The green beans were fantastic and here they\\'ll actually serve you half a sausage. A local Lyft driver directed us here during our visit and the food was outstanding. We went with brisket and ribs per other recommendations and both were amazing. The brisket basically melted in your mouth and the ribs needed no bbq sauce they were so full of flavor. We loved being able to scoop our own sides too. This was my first in-Texas bbq experience and it did not disappoint! My mom and I have been here two times and we are impressed with the brisket, pork ribs and sausage. We liked the moist brisket and the dessert was delicious. The peach cobbler is the best ever. We like the Texas atmosphere and music...the best BBQ in Texas I have eaten ever. It is better than Salt Lick! We love Terry Blacks. The convenience and location to downtown make it a must, especially if you are staying nearby. You\\'ve got to try some Texas BBQ. Arguably, this isn\\'t the best bbq in Austin, but it\\'s still delicious! \\n\\nWhen you drive by you\\'ll see the size of this place from the road. Parking can be a pain but as soon as you walk in you will be amazed. The smell. \\n\\nWe love to order to go and pick it up for parties and large amounts of family in town. Just give yourself an hour or so for them to prepare it! Worth. The. Wait. Grab a beer and be patient because the ribs are life changing! We were a group of 7 and I got to try ALLLL THE MEATS! the turkey was low on my list to order until I tried it, and by far one of the best. The cole slaw, incredible. Mac and cheese, incredible! Zero complaints, and the services was great. Everyone was helpful and had a smile on their face. Also, if you\\'re looking for a scooter, this is the spot to find one easily Definitely great amounts of meat. Great place to eat in a group or by yourself. Went with a couple of friends and was not disappointed. The ribs were so delicious, the meat practically fell right off the bone! Would definitely go there again... I\\'m getting hungry just thinking about the place. All I can say is,  WOW!!!! The food here is amazing! Each and every time we go, it never disappoints! Their sides are fantastic, but the BBQ, it\\'s perfection! The staff is always friendly and will show you the ropes. The outside patio is always a nice place to sit and enjoy the cooler evening weather. We make the almost 2 hr drive down to Austin once a month for this place. If you haven\\'t tried them, you must! Best bbq in Texas!!! The brisket is phenomenal. You don\\'t even need a knife to cut it. The spare ribs are also really juicy and tasty. The potato salad, green beans, and cobbler is also a must. When we arrived at the restaurant there were ling lines and I was thinking it mush be really good because people are waiting in line. We ordered brisket and sausages for sides we chose mac n cheese, Spanish rice, coleslaw and corn. They did not disappoint us. I first tried the mac n cheese and that is the best mac n cheese I ever had. The corn is really good too I should\\'ve ordered the bigger size. The brisket are super good its soft and moist. Sausages are very good too i love the jalapeño and cheese. Sauces are amazing. I will go back and eat here soon. All the food are amazing! We love terry blacks!!! This is where we bring all of our out of town guests to really enjoy true Texan bbq!!! Seating may be a little tricky when it\\'s busy, but it\\'s so worth it!!! Met my brother from South Dakota for our annual lunch. Fantastic place to share a yummy true Texas BarBQ with family & friends!  We will be back! So good, cafeteria style bbq. Step in line choose your sides before deciding on a meat. Always helpful, always filling Visiting relatives in Austin again. We\\'re from California and we have nothing like this out here. This place was amazing! I go to barbecue for the brisket and this was moist, which is really hard to find. Usually it\\'s very dry or full of fat. This was perfect. The only problem is we\\'re back in California and I\\'m craving this place. We will definitely return next time we\\'re in Texas. The place is so yummy! I loved the bark on the brisket. The staff was super friendly. Very happy and satisfied. They have plenty of outside seating. Our our last trip to Austin, we always have to make a BBQ stop.  We used to do Rudy\\'s but now that Rudy\\'s has expanded so much around the State, it\\'s not quite Austin anymore.  Also, with BBQ being king in Austin, so many new great options are out there.  We were told the new hot spot was Terry Black\\'s.  So I was expecting a LONG line.  However, this place was set up as cafeteria style.  Meaning, you walk up, get your sides pick your meat and they cut it up for you.  They have BEEF RIBS!!! These things are beasts, super tender, a little on the fatty side if you\\'re up for it.  I actually enjoyed their moist brisket more, just because you get more for the value because you\\'re not paying for the bone.  Their jalapeno sausage was just OK, their cream corn had a hint of cinnamon? the mac and cheese was delicious! \\n\\nTheir BBQ does not need sauce, but they offer 3 options, original, spicy, and sweet.  All 3 were great, but my favorite was the sweet.  You could just dip plain bread in the sauce and be happy.  \\n\\nTLDR: Get Brisket, Short lines. Amazing flavor here. I\\'ve been three times and been more than satisfied every time. Awesome beef ribs, possibly best in town. From a born and bred austinite, I know bbq and these guys do too. Never a bad meal here. Tasty hot sides and deserts are just a bonus. Glad they\\'re here. Awesome spot! Loved the environment and the area  for a Monday night it was still pretty crowded but the ambiance was very fun and welcoming, my brother and I strolled in not really knowing how the quality was going to be but they did not disappoint cafeteria style bbq like most places but all the food was delicious, I know bbq is all about the meats but the sides can definitely be the main attraction, the MAC was absolute fire, the green beans was my favorite must try, the sweet corn was my 3rd pick but still delicious,  \\n\\nI order with my eyes instead of my stomach and it was worth it. 1 lbs moist tender brisket. 1 lbs of beef rib (1 rib that could definitely feed 2). 1 lbs of sausages (original) and everything was cooked to perfection. I had a great experience I will definitely return with more friends and family to show this place off! I gave Terry a five star rating not because everything was 5 stars, although the Mexican corn is damn close, but because overall it\\'s top notch\\n\\nAmazing corn\\nVery good sausage and peach cobbler\\n\\nAnd of course Dr Pepper\\n\\nGreat atmosphere for families or a date. Decent prices and good bar b que sauce. The original is the best but you have to try the sweet. \\n\\nI will absolutely come back! Terry Blacks provided the food for my wedding with approx. 50 guests. They were very professional with planning, responsive and thorough. They delivered the food on time and for the exact price they committed to. \\n\\nEveryone LOVED the food, the word everyone used to describe it was EXCELLENT. Most people went for 2nds and 3rds, we ordered more food than needed and have a bunch of skinny friends and it was pretty much gone by the end of the night. All 50+ guests were pleased and ranted about the quality, even with it sitting for about 2 hours prior to being served. For a Kansas City boy, this is done good BBQ!  The baked beans are almost better than the meat. Brisket and Turkey are the best! Hands down the best BBQ I\\'ve ever had! Wish I went back everyday while I was in Texas. Came for the BBQ and left oh so satisfied. I\\'m from out of town and heard this place is a must since it\\'s the happy medium of waiting in not so long of lines and bomb Texas BBQ. We waited in a 20/25 min line where you serve yourself some sides first and then go up to the counter where you tell them how much meat you want and they cut it up and weigh it right in front of you. Expect to pay around $20 for a meal. The meat was so juicy and tender and the ribs are a must! I\\'ll definitely come back to Terry\\'s when I\\'m in Austin. Terry Black\\'s is my friend\\'s absolute favorite bbq place and I can see why. We came together one night because he couldn\\'t stop talking about it :) I am not by any means a bbq expert, but I do like meat and I do like home style cooking. It turns out that the meat is really tastey with tons of awesome sides and a home-cooked appeal. I had the brisket with cobbler and mac n cheese. I was stuffed, I think I ate half at the restaurant and then made a sandwich the next 2 days with the remaining leftovers. I also loved the buffet style and that they had bottled IPA available. \\n\\nAnother selling point: The fact that they are so popular that they started running out of meat!  I don\\'t what it is about seeing the choices diasappear that makes things interesting, but it was definitely exciting to suddenly see the pork ribs run out and a sign get plastered to the window saying \"sold out\". I guess it makes you feel like you made a good choice. :) While visiting Austin we had to try one \"highly reviewed\" BBQ restaurant and we went with Terry Blacks primarily because they had the best sides listed on their menus. \\nIt is a little pricey, but most BBQ is and this place is competitively priced! \\n\\nOverall it was great! I would highly recommend!\\n\\nWe ordered \\nsliced brisket - delicious \\nChopped beef sandwich - delicious \\nMacaroni and cheese - delicious \\nPinto beans - good\\nbanana pudding - just ok\\n\\nIf you are going during lunch hours, plan to wait at least 20-30 minutes before you can order. Man oh man i am a fan. The food here is just delicious. I have been here a couple of times and when it comes to BBQ these guys do it right. Multiple sauces and great choices for a classic BBQ style restaurant. Their sides are great and the buffet style option is not bad compared to the original location. Lines can be a little long but still not as bad as other locations. Customer service is hit or miss. I apologize Texas[See Shaq on Hot Ones]. Nearly 8 years in Texas and this was my first time trying brisket. I\\'ll have to say it was some good moisty moist meat. Some of the moistiest I\\'ve ever had. The beef ribs were the same. My only takeaway from making 5 stars is the brisket was a tad too salty and the beef ribs seemed like it was mostly fat. But for now, this will be the bar. Lookout Texas, I\\'m coming for more brisket soon. The line can be a bit long, but they move people through efficiently.  The price is high as barbeque goes, but the food was as good as I had heard.  The beef ribs are my favorite.  This doesn\\'t miss a beat from the family restaurant in Lockhart in my opinion. Deeeeeeeeeeeee-licious!  Everything I had was done right.  I felt like I was in the country instead of in the heart of the city.  Reasonable prices, friendly staff and great location.  Definitely worth checking out. We could smell the smoking bbq meat all the way from the lake. It just makes you crave bbq! We got the brisket which was amazing and the beef rib which was HUGE. The best sides is the green beans (which they seem to cook in the meat fat). Delish!! \\n\\nWe left stuffed but happy! We traveled almost 5 hours to get here. The brisket is always on point. Smoked edges and perfectly seasoned. We ordered the $99 family pack with 3 pounds of meat and 5 sides. We definitely had enough and enjoyed leftovers. My kids loved the macaroni, they had enough with one large side of it. The beans were good but I would not order them again. The coleslaw was great. Definitely a good side to have while eating brisket. A small rib is also a good add on if your super hungry. And don\\'t forget the tea, it\\'s freshly brewed. The jalapeños are .65 cents each but also a good addition if you need a little kick with your food. We loved all the food we got!! We ordered beef ribs, jalapeño sausage, pork ribs and brisket sandwiches and it was all delicious. Between all of us, we all got sides and we loved the homemade macaroni and the sweet creamy corn was the best!! This is a 5 star bbq restaurant. Lines move quick so don\\'t be afraid to wait. Staff is super friendly and make you feel welcomed. Brisket which for me defines Texas BBQ, theirs is amazing. Moist and tender defines their meats. Only downside is I\\'m not a huge fan of their sides but who cares, I eat BBQ for the meat. I also really enjoy the cold beer that have on site. Great place. Awesome location. Cool atmosphere. What is wrong with me? Why have I waited all these years to try this place. Hands down, this is the best bbq I\\'ve ever tried. Me and a friend arrived around 12:30 on a Tuesday to have lunch here and good lord, we scarfed down every bit of our shared tray. We got about 6 slices of brisket, a few pork ribs, seasoned corn, Mexican rice, and Mac and cheese. Every bite sent me to heaven. The brisket and the Mac and cheese were definitely the key players but everything was just perfect in seasoning, taste, and heat. The complimentary bread and pickles and bbq sauce were the cherry on top and well rounded out meal. We left full and happy and I cannot wait to bring back more friends here! The best bbq that you can have. The beef rib is to die for. Heavenly, fall off the bone delicious. By far the best I\\'ve ever had. The brisket is tender and delicious. Texas smoked bbq at its best.\\n\\nThe sides are good but don\\'t load up on them as you want to save yourself for the food. No need to wait in line at Franklins or drive out to the BBQ strongholds. This is absolutely legit Texas BBQ. We especially like their brisket.\\n\\nGreat location in a very cool part of town.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be glad you\\'ve tried it. Black\\'s BBQ is one of the best in Austin by far. I would put them as number 1 because you dont have to wait outside like Franklins for hours just to find out they sold out 3 people before you. They have enough for everyone. The wait is not terrible. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Great spot to get some good BBQ and that beef rib is the most tender piece of meat i have had in my life!!! I ate it with a plastic fork. Get there ASAP It may not be the best in town, but it is damn consistent and never has more than a 10 minute wait like other spots. I\\'ve been here a handful of times and the brisket is always in point, pork ribs always above-average (if not great), but lately I\\'ve started to just get the chopped beef sandwich with a rib. Economical, tasty, and ridiculously huge sandwich. If you don\\'t have time to wait in huge lines at some more popular places, can\\'t recommend Terry B\\'s enough. Are here the first night I was in Austin. Amazing food. Best meal I had while visiting Austin. Terry Black\\'s re-set the bar for me- now, admittedly, I\\'m just a silly northern girl, but I had some concept of great barbecue or so I thought. We hit Terry Black\\'s during a crush on Saturday- well worth the wait and the place really turns tables fast, so the line moves quick. They are a well oiled machine when it comes to running things- cafeteria style self- service on the sides ( each little paper boat you fill is 1.98) and there is a good selection of surprisingly delicious sides- the green beans were my favorite- not mushy but also not hard, perfectly cooked, beautifully seasoned- couldn\\'t stop eating them. We got a little bit of the brisket ( meats are ordered by 1/3, 1/2, 3/4 or 1 pound increments) 4 pork ribs and one sausage. They were all PERFECT- you could cut the beef and pork with a spoon and the sausage had the perfect snap and spice. Sauces were good- the spicy was great. Oh and don\\'t forget to fill a little paper boat with the hot peach cobbler- it was perfection as well. Terry  Blacks- you\\' ve made a BFF out of me! Terry blacks was very good. Expensive - but worth the price. The rub was the size of my buddies face. Don\\'t expect to do anything active after this meal. If you\\'re looking for some DARN good BBQ in Austin - THIS is where to go. After hearing about how long the wait gets at Franklin\\'s, I was immediately recommended to go to Terry\\'s because it\\'s just as good. \\nI came here on a Saturday afternoon, and waited about 10 minutes before I got to the self-serve sides - they had everything from corn, mac and cheese, slaw, etc. Then you get directed to the butcher, to pick your meats. I got the brisket, MOIST, and it was delicious - it basically melted in my mouth. You can order the meats starting at 1/3 a pound. The BBQ sauce options are in squeeze bottles on the tables, and the 3 sauces were all really tasty. My biggest regret was not ordering the beef ribs, but now I have all the more reason to come back to Austin! My first official review as Austin Yelp Elite and I am very glad that Terry Black\\'s is my first one. I went with my classmates at around 1:30 pm on Sunday. There was a pretty long line, which went on to the outside of the restaurant but the wait wasn\\'t too bad because the line kept moving and once you get inside, you can buy the drink first from the fridge. \\n\\nWe picked the sides first - I got corns and green beans. These sides were all so good. Especially the corns were amazing! Very creamy and optimally sweet. Some places, the corns are overwhelmingly sweet but Terry Black\\'s was perfect. \\n\\nAfter the sides, you move on to get the meat. I got two slices of beef brisket and a pork rib. The beef briskets were the best Ive ever had. Coming from Houston, I\\'ve had briskets at other Texan bbq places and honestly Terry Black had the juiciest, moist, tasty briskets ever. Next time I go back, I will just get the briskets. (Pork rib was just ok and little bit dry)\\n\\nI will definitely go back to Terry Black\\'s and highly recommend it! A fun place for a casual group dinner. Food was really amazing. But biggest surprise? My favorite thing was the creamed corn. \\n\\nWill report that other people in my group raved about the beef rib and brisket. DUDE! If you\\'re not BBQ aware than go try Rudy\\'s or some other sub par place and then come tuck in to some real brisket at Terry Blacks! I mean holy shit... \\n\\nBrisket that melts into your very soul on the way to your stomach, beef ribs that slid effortlessly off the enormous bone, macaroni done the way I imagine it\\'s inventor could only dream of. Staff that know what\\'s important; satisfying your deepest, darkest bbq desires. Everyone\\'s friendly and knowledgeable about what \"you gotta try\" next. Listen to them, let them guide you through this wonderland of meat. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in town and you don\\'t have em on your list to try you\\'re gonna need to re-evaluate why you came to Auston in the first place. And then stay home next time cause we don\\'t want cha! Amazing food .......it was our first time there but will come back whenever we visit Texas again. The meat was fresh and juicy and the servers were very nice. It was a bit pricey but worth the amount. Don\\'t go for too much of the sides as they are nothing to drool for. Also the sides were a bit salty but I would give 10/10 for the meat A copycat of the original Blacks from Lockhart, but this location gets my vote!  Consistent quality and great location with easy parking close to downtown.  Their brisket is to die for! This was hands down the best bbq I\\'ve ever had in my life! I\\'m from Ohio so we don\\'t have as many bbq options but we just were asking around where to eat and this was highly recommended. The ribs were so delicious the meat fell off the bone. The cornbread was like cake it was so good! The corn side you must try! It was sweet and like nothing I\\'ve ever had before. So good! The food was pricey but that\\'s standard for bbq. The one cool thing I liked about this place was the bar they let you order drinks while in line so if you are waiting for 45 minutes in the blazing sun it\\'s at least not as bad with a cold beer in your hand lol it was about $4.50 a beer (IPA) If you want good southern BBQ this is the place to go. It is out of the world! They measure the meat by weight so it can get expensive. I highly recommend coming here if you are in Austin! We ended up here because we just have time to go to Lochart to our favorite blacks.  Great atmosphere but it felt more like eating in a giant canteen. The BBQ was great and sides were really good too and I\\'m not a slaw fan!! Also really enjoyed their jalapeño sweet corn bread.  A bit expensive though. The best barbecue I ever had!!! The brisket is very flavored and seasoned. The meat is so tender. WOW!  Yup that sums it up!  WOW! Brisket, and pork ribs.  But wait there\\'s more, it\\'s called what the heck is this banana pudding!  So damn good my taste buds were dancing.  \\n\\nNow let\\'s get back to the business of brisket. Where to begin?!  So juicy, so tender, fall of the bone, a harmony of sweet, salty, savory, smoky, and deliciousness.  Thank you Austin for having the title of \"Best BBQ\"!  After 3 days of searching for the perfect brisket , I am happy to say that I found it in you Terry Black.  Hey tourist - don\\'t miss out on this experience. And locals, how I envy you for having Terry Black\\'s brisket at your whim!  Sorry Austin for adding to that long line.  But why come all the way to Austin and not experience this nirvana.  \\n\\nDon\\'t bring a vegetarian inside Terry\\'s because they might just switch those celery sticks  for that pork rib and brisket. Fantastic food and fun atmosphere. Signage on the outside would be helpful for those of us who have never been before and aren\\'t familiar with the setup, but we basically followed the crowds into a line and eventually ended up at the food counter. We had brisket and original sausage with a few sides, and the platter was mouth wateringly good! Our favorite go-to BBQ spot! The meat is delicious, the sides are wonderful (especially the mac & cheese), & you get a true sense of Texas BBQ without a crazy wait. We love coming here on the regular to get our BBQ fix and to enjoy the fun environment! Don\\'t forget to try their delicious BBQ sauces as well- they complete the meal! This is a cafeteria style dining establishment that doesn\\'t sacrifice on food quality! You pay by weight of meat and a flat rate for each side. It can get really crowded here with really tight parking so I recommend you plan accordingly. \\n\\nThe meats that are offered here are fresh and cooked really well. The price isn\\'t too bad, but a bit high for a cafe style spot. Either way, I\\'d definitely come back here again. Next time though, I\\'d skip out on a few sides (I got too many) Amazing food and good location. Their brisket is my favorite! I love that their service is quick and always friendly. We arrived close to closing time so we didn\\'t get to try the ribs but the brisket was very good. The sausage was ok but the brisket was much better. I would have liked to go back again to try more things on the menu but we were only in town for a few days. Maybe next trip. Went to Austin Tx for daughters wedding.  The family wanted BBQ. Good food.  Not to formal Fun not to expensive.  Terry Blacks BBQ hit all the needs.  The staff exceeded them.  Easy menu for large hungry family.  And the Beer was cold!!!!   Try it it was great Terry Blacks BBQ.....excellent brisket, amazing beef bites. The bbq sauce was a little too runny for me. I like thick bbq sauce. Everything was great overall. Amazing!  Austinites are so blessed to have so many incredible bbq options. Terry Black\\'s is no exception. \\n\\nBrisket- this was done to perfection. It would have placed in the top 5 of any bbq competition. The bark was excellent, deep dark smoke ring and incredibly moist for the flat, which is the hardest to achieve. \\n\\nPork Ribs -  I know he\\'s known for beef ribs but the pork was perfect. The rub wasn\\'t my style but it was good and the ribs were large and done to perfection. \\n\\nSausage- very nice and homemade. Smoked just enough\\n\\nNice condiments, the pecan pie looked incredible. I had potato salad and beans which were both homemade and absolutely ideal. The only negative is that because I arrived at the beginning of lunch hour the bbq sauce dispensers were just pulled from the fridge and ice cold. Not a good compliment to great bbq. Hence I did not get a chance to enjoy the three flavors they had available. \\n\\nNote to Terry:  please come to Ft. Worth!  We need you desperately!!! I ordered creame corn, green beans, peach cobbler, potato salad, brisket and beef ribs. I like the beef ribs and green beans. The flavor was really good. Nice place to come back. Great BBQ, long lines but worth the wait. I even bought myself a burnt orange Terry Blacks shirt for the UT game and I received a lot of compliments. Make sure you wear your stretchy pants because you\\'re going to need them. Amazing ! Out of this world bbq ! Try this place out you won\\'t be disappointed! The beef rib & jalapeño sausage are to die for Always a great experience. Don\\'t let the line scare you away. Moves quickly and the food is amazing The first place I take anyone when they come into town! Everything is amazing and friendly staff!! Great food, tastes fresh, friendly helpful staff. All around great place. Beautiful, rustic feel to the dining room. Catering is amazing too! Everything is always hot and fresh Wow.  Great great great Texas bbq.  Very impressed.  The brisket and sausage are incredible.  The sweet corn was awesome and so we\\'re the pinto beans.  Literally a line out the door.... But worth the ten minute wait. Highly recommend. I came here after several recommendations. I\\'m sorry I waited.  The service is great. Cafeteria style, with busboys ready to pick up after you and keeping the joint spotless. Now the food. WOW. I\\'m a BBQ snob. I admit. So I have high expectations. Especially for Texas BBQ. I had the brisket. Spare ribs & beans. And a Big Red, of course. On point. The rub wasn\\'t as spicy as I usually prefer, but awesome nonetheless. I could really taste the brown sugar in the rub. The beans were phenomenal. I\\'ll most certainly be back. Been here three times and counting. The beef ribs  are fall of the bone, lip smacking good! The sides are not half bad! The Mac n cheese is delightful, as is the creamed corn. The cobbler is OK, average. I wouldn\\'t waste my time on more than a side or two Bc it\\'s all about the meat! You only really need one beef rib Bc it\\'s HUGE and good luck finishing that thing, but hey leftovers for days! The brisket and the sausage are also good!! I don\\'t really like barbecue sauce but love the three varieties they have! The spicy is my fav - has a little kick to it, tangy and delicious. They also have OG, and sweet which are also good! Highly recommend!!! The brisket and beef ribs were OMG, melt in my mouth, wonderful! There was a line for dinner but it was well worth the wait. The sides were also good but just one tiny gripe is that they have chunks of garlic on their green beans. Garlic makes my stomach ill so I had to pass on my favorite greens. Just like me, it wasn\\'t cheap but definitely worth the chaching! BBQ- IT is! Firts time in TX- do recommend pork ribs and Cole slaw- it was delicious- must try the Native Texan beer. Great food and fabulous service. Best BBQ ever /  Brisket was cooked to perfection and the meat fell off the ribs - all the sides are made from scratch and were awesome - well worth the wait in line ! This was one of my best meals ever.  Really loved this place.  It was perfect.  Yes a little pricy but worth it.  I had the brisket and ribs.  Yum yum.  No mixed drinks here it\\'s beer and wine. The food is outstanding.  They had a singer during dinner. I had the beans, and slaw.  This is a must stop in Austin. The best BBQ in Texas. Hands down. The brisket sliced to order (keep the fat!) and the chicken are incredibly juicy, moist and smokey. Don\\'t miss it!! Best BBQ in Texas!  Friendly staff and owners, super location.  Food amazing!   Can\\'t wait till they setup in Dallas! Beat brisket I\\'ve ever had, the Mac n cheese is amazing, I don\\'t like Cole slaw, but there\\'s has changed my mind. Overall I have 0 complaints. Amazing BBQ Stopped by here since it was close to my hotel.  Probably the best pork ribs and brisket I\\'ve ever had.  The sauce was just ok. BBQ capital of the US!!!! \\nSo you arrive in Texas and you HAVE to try real BBQ- so many choices to choose from!!!\\n\\nWe decided on Terry\\'s and were not disappointed at all!!!\\n\\nIt\\'s the old school cafeteria trays that just adds to the atmosphere and fun of a good ol BBQ.\\n\\nYou grab your trays and load up on your sides. All were great!\\n\\nThen onto the meat.. oh boy.. I have to say the turkey was my favorite and I don\\'t even eat turkey on thanksgiving . But Terry\\'s is so Smokey and soft. So yummy\\n\\nPlenty of free parking.\\n\\nBeers were off the hook. Lots to choose from. They do have a red and white wine also if you want.\\n\\nLots of\\nOutside seating with to-go containers handy for you. \\n\\nIf you are in Austin you should go!!! The brisket is divine. I\\'ve eaten at all the Austin BBQ joins as well as those in surrounding towns, and I\\'ve got to say this was the best-tasting brisket and best all-around experience I\\'ve had. We got an impromptu tour of the BBQ pits and met the brothers in charge--they are incredibly nice and impressive young men. It\\'s hard to believe the experience was so solid given the short time the restaurant has been open and and the youth of the owners, but they\\'ve got four generations of BBQ masters behind them, and it showed. Delicious! I also enjoyed the green beans and pinto beans. A perfect meal! GO! Bring your friends and out-of-town guests for Texas BBQ at its finest. Sorry Franklin, THIS is the best BBQ in Austin! Everything is so incredibly tender and moist, home made sides could be a meal by themselves. This place never disappoints. And their secret recipe sweet and tangy sauce rivals the legendary salt lick. A must try for anyone who loves barbecue in Texas!\\n\\nAnd for those complaining about fatty cuts, you do realize you can ask for \"lean\"? Cows aren\\'t sumo wrestlers, you can get a good cut, just ask... Unless you go late in the day, that\\'s your own fault. Every good BBQ joint saves the bad cuts for the end of the day. And the guy that complained that the ribs \"fell off the bone\"... It\\'s supposed to do that! SMH.  That\\'s the result of perfect smoking. If you want the meat to stay on the bone, skip the smoker and just microwave it. Yum Best brisket that I\\'ve got so far. There was a long line but it moved fast. It was crowded and busy but the staff asked us how many seats we would need right after we finished paying, so it was really helpful for us to be seated fast. Me and my bf definitely will come back. The scents coming from the smoke house will make your mouth water.  A variety of brisket, turkey, sausage and ribs by the pound.  Traditional sides are available.  I had a brisket sandwich with dill pickles and bbq sauce, along with the slaw and potato salad sides.  \\n\\nThe brisket was melt in your mouth, smokey goodness.  The dill pickles and sauce made it a perfect bite. The slaw was the perfect combination of sweet and tart.  They put  curley parsley in it with red and whit cabbage and carrots.  Great cruch.  The potato salad was off the sweeter variety. \\n\\nServings were huge.  Sides were 5 ounces, pints or quarts.  You could order family style and share.\\n\\nThe restaurant is loud and somewhat of a sensory overload.  The line up front is cafeteria style serving.  The decor is down home and then some.  Actually the women\\'s restroom reminded me of camp latrines, but it worked.  \\n\\nI gave them 5 stars for the delicious bbq.  Next time I will order out to avoid the boisterousness. Best barbecue all four of us had ever had and best meal during our Texas trip. We got in a little early for lunch (11:45) and there was barely a line. We drank some of their local beers while waiting and then fired up an order of a rib, brisket, mac n cheese, potato salad and green beans. Everything was wonderfully seasoned and delicious. There was no use for the sauces because of how flavorful each bite was. Outdoor seating was nice, but there were a few birds eyeing our food in the tent. Very glad we stopped in here and highly recommend. Cool concept, great atmosphere, long line that moved fast, friendly service. My husband and I looked on Yelp to find a good BBQ place while in Austin and came upon Terry Black\\'s. We ordered brisket and pork ribs, mac n cheese, potato salad, coleslaw, we were hungry! Stopped at a nearby park to chow down because the place was crowded. The meats were saltier than we cared for, but moist and tender. The ribs fell off the bone like I like it. The sides were fantastic. Had enough meat left over and polished it off in a sandwich. Tasted better two days later. If we get back there, we\\'ll try the sausage and some of that peach cobbler. Beyond delicious, mouth watering BBQ. Great atmosphere inside and out and ownership seems to really care about pleasing their customers. Highly recommended over any other BBQ joint in Austin. Some of the best BBQ I have ever had, and I have tried a lot.  The cornbread is awesome, just the right amount of sweet, and the brisket and ribs were melt in your mouth tender Amazing Barbecue!!! I grew up in Texas and I know barbecue! This is in the top 3 places that I really like. I spent $52 for two, worth every dollar!! A must go if you are in Austin!! Best meal I\\'ve had so far in the USA! Loved it all! We had beef brisket, macaroni cheese, coleslaw, beans and potato salad.  Delicious.  Great choice of beer and drinks, great atmosphere and friendly staff! Bbq was good. Got 1 pound of brisket and 0.5 pounds of beef ribs. Sides, mac and cheese with potato salad. Not the best bbq but would go back. I\\'m typically not a huge fan of bbq... but there\\'s something about this place that has me coming back for more, when I visit ATX.  Staff are always friendly and helpful. During my last visit I came on a Saturday night around 630pm so I figured there\\'d be a long line. Even though there was a line out the door, the wait time was not that long (30-45mins). If you\\'re ever in the area or not, you need to stop by and try Terry\\'s bbq! This place definitely lives up to the hype! Every time I go I am not disappointed. It\\'s quick and easy to get through the line (just get there right when they open to beat the rush!). I love being able to choose my sides and watch them cut my choice of meat right in front of me. \\n\\nGet the brisket AND the ribs -- don\\'t mess around. The jalapeno cheese sausage is also fantastic. And the mac and cheese -- YUM! They truly do Texas BBQ right here, and have plenty of outdoor seating. \\n\\nIf you dine in you do have to go inside to make your way through the line, and it is a bit challenging to socially distance while you\\'re waiting (and checking out.)\\n\\nBut, truly, this is worth the stop, whether you\\'re a visitor or a local! AMAZING! Best sausage of my life (the cheddar variety). Very fast service and outrageously delicious. Also, the pit master gave us an awesome tour of the smoker facility. Bbq at its finest to say the least. \\nGot the brisket & chopped beef w/ 3 sides \\nMac n cheese, green beans, and some Cole slaw. \\nNot even a huge fan of coleslaw but it was tasty nonetheless. Parking sucks; expect lines, but it\\'s worth in my opinion. Moist Brisket- very good. Surprisingly our pieces didn\\'t have that much fat like I was expecting. Personally I thought it was a tad salty though\\n\\nPork ribs- very good! literally fell off the bone. More tender than Rudy\\'s. 3 ribs were less than a lb.\\n\\nJalapeno cheddar sausage- flavor was just ok, but it lacked the snap/firmness we prefer so didn\\'t care for it. More of a mushy texture. Prefer Rudy\\'s. 1 entire link was about 1/3 lb\\n\\nJalapeno cornbread- surprisingly really good and I don\\'t even like cornbread. I only got it bc of the reviews. it\\'s only $1 and huge. Slightly sweet and moist like a muffin!\\n\\nMac n cheese- favorite side. Right amount of cheesiness and creaminess\\n\\npotato salad- pretty good\\n\\ngreen beans- good bc you need some greens but a tad salty. I saw a lot of people choose this side\\n\\nLiked the sweet bbq sauce over the original and spicy. There\\'s unlimited white sliced bread (very soft!) by the drinks, raw red onions, and sliced pickles. Jalapenos however are 35c each.\\n\\nSpent $38 for 2 (surprisingly not as pricey as I expected). Had some leftover potato salad, brisket, sausage, a rib, and cornbread. Very informal with a large area inside and out. Serves cafeteria style, line can be quite long. The potato salad, coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, and green beans were all very good sides. The brisket is absolutely one of the best I\\'ve had. Not cheap but really high-quality meat have already gone back for take out. Hands down the best brisket i have ever had.  I was a little concerned that i went towards the latter part of the day and i would be having meat that had been sitting around for a long time, not the case at all.  The ovens were still burning.  I have been to many of these \"cult\" restaurants where the staff can be obnoxious, not here.  Great good, great attitude. Only thing i would skip would be the pecan pie. I hate you, Terry Black.  You ruined barbecue for me, forever (or, at least until the next time I\\'m in Texas).  Our large group ordered brisket and beef ribs by the pound, and we were in heaven. Never have I had meat that flavorful, juicy, tender...meat that melts off the bone and into your mouth.  I tried another famed BBQ spot upon returning to Chicago, and was grossly let down.  I have a feeling that will be the case, until I return! I don\\'t go to church, but if you look up John 3:16 in the Bible and replace \"son\" with \"Terry Black\\'s Barbecue\", you would understand the religious experience I just had eating there. It\\'s so good I\\'m going to come back here from NYC just to eat it again. I\\'m in a meatcase of emotion. I can\\'t even. No long lines, friendly people and delicious BBQ...the sides and desserts are so good by far its the Best  mouth watering BBQ in TEXAS! My first time having Texas bbq in Texas. Overall, everything was pretty delicious. The sides were all very good. I thought it was a pretty cool concept that we got to pick our own sides and then they would slice our meats for us. The brisket was delicious! The only downfall, the pork ribs were very peppery which made the ribs very salty. The seasoning took away from the quality of the meat. Even the pickles on the side were pretty salty too. Not a bad place! I would come here again. The best pork ribs and brisket in Austin from what I\\'ve tasted. It beat out La BBQ for sure, but not when it came to the beef rib, I\\'d pick La on that one. Overall great experience and from the size of the restaurant, it\\'s a pretty damn healthy business. We got there right at 11am and were the first in line. Talking about it now makes me sweat, and I\\'m proud to say these dudes nailed it. Loved it all. Great experience and super service! Nice work. An Austin classic. I visited here with my pork-loving boyfriend, and he said it was the best BBQ he\\'s ever had. I myself am a vegetarian, so I expected we\\'d go there just for him, and I\\'d nibble on some sad wilted leaf, but I was pleasantly surprised by the number of delicious vegetarian options! After we ate, we walked outside for an impromptu and informal tour of the barbecue pits, where the workers keep the meat smoking and cooking for days before it\\'s ready to serve. I recommend going during the off hours (after 2:30pm) to avoid the insane lines. Awesome BBQ!  Brought some friends from out of town in to have lunch.  The line moved fast and the food was great.  Parking wasn\\'t too bad either.  I will definitely come back again! Fabulous barbecue. A little pricey but so worth it. The beef ribs are the biggest I\\'ve ever seen & they\\'re delicious We drove to Terry Black\\'s directly from the airport on a Saturday night. The line was long as expected but moved pretty quickly. We researched bbq places before flying into Austin and this was high on the list. And boy we were not disappointed. Their brisket, jalapeño sausage and ribs were so delicious and totally hit the spot. Creamed corn and banana pudding were both amazing. The food is definitely worth the wait. Servers were friendly; bussers kept the tables clean and they even have cute stuff in the mini gift shop. Casual, no-frills dining with excellent meats! We went to Micklethwait BBQ the following day and consensus from the group is Terry Black\\'s is waaay better! We highly recommend and we can\\'t wait to return. Creamed corn, potato salad and beans are all solid. Cheddar sausage is great. Fatty brisket is very very good but lean brisket was very salty Perfect Authentic Texas BBQ. The line is always long but it\\'s well worth the wait. The entire time in line, we wondered how it worked so here it is: \\n\\nStep 1: Grab a tray\\nStep 2: Scoop the sides\\nStep 3: Choose your meat\\nStep 4: Smile & be happy you\\'re in Texas eating BBQ. \\n\\nWhether you\\'re a tourist like I was, or a local, Terry Black\\'s Barbeque is the best for BBQ. This place is not overrated! It is amazing! I had the sausage and brisket, both of them were ridiculously good! Was in town for 3 days for work and this place was so good I ate there twice. Amazing fall apart brisket and the beef ribs were insane! One of the best BBQ places in Austin! Loved everything here! The only thing was parking is limited but it won\\'t stop me from coming back here again! Although Franklin\\'s is king, Terry Black\\'s is a very close second! It\\'s perfect because it\\'s right in the middle of Austin and you don\\'t have to wait hours in line for some delicious meats! Honestly everything is good but I would definitely put brisket & pork ribs top on my list. As for sides the mac and cheese and cornbread are my faves. You scoop the sides yourself, it\\'s cafeteria style and they charge by the container. If you\\'re indecisive like me, I like to put a little bit of 2-3 sides into one container so I can try it all rather than putting each side in its own to save money. The only downside is that this place is becoming so popular now that the wait is getting longer and longer. But 10/10 would still recommend, just come during off peak times to avoid the crowd! hands down the best BBQ I\\'ve ever had. TB\\'s is a bit more on the expensive side, however it\\'s worth every single penny. We had the brisket, pork ribs, sausage, mac& cheese, beans, and corn. \\n\\nBrisket - 10/10, soft, tender, juicy, and flavored \\nRibs - 10/10 fell off the bone, tender, juicy and a good pepper flavor\\nSausage - 10/10 perfect texture and flavor \\nMac&Cheese - 10/10 perfect amount of cheese, good texture and flavor\\nCorn - 10/10 for sweet creamy corn\\nBeans - 6/10 had a gritty texture , flavor was pretty good though \\n\\nI will definitely be back to Terry Black\\'s and I 100% recommend it!! Wow!   This place has the most amazing beef ribs!   Their brisket was awesome too.  I can also recommend their Mac n cheese, beans, slaw and cobbler.  They were all excellent.  The food was nicely complemented by outstanding service.  Thanks!  We will be back. Omg this is a must !! You should not leave without this experience !! The ribs( pork and beef) are out of this world, brisket awesome and tender, the sausage - jalapeño cheddar and the regular was just so tender and perfectly smoked \\nPerhaps cobbler ok but the the pecan pie is delicious - don\\'t forget to try corn muffin!!\\nCole slaw very fresh, macaroni and cheese was very buttery!!\\nThank you  for a great meal !! Worth the wait in line !! We came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and our Uber drivers recs.  On a Friday at 6 PM and the wait was about 30 minutes. Even though the lines were long it moved pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe drink selection were pretty varied. The great fruit cider and black margarita were on point. We tried a little of all the sides and chose the smallest option.  The mac & cheese and cornbread was my favorite.\\n\\nMeat wise they let you see it and decide how much you want in front of you before you pay. We had the lean brisket which was so tender. The pork ribs were all so smoky and fresh. It was falling off the bone. The jalapeño cheese sausage was also super moist.\\n\\nWe checked out the huge smoke house in the back.  So cool.  Overall would definitely be back! Not much to say about one of the best BBQ places in Texas other than it lives up to its reputation. Ordered a little bit of everything and went on a weekday which meant no lines and plenty of options on food! Does not get better than that! Sweet tea was the beverage of choice. Every meat on the menu was on the plate except for the beef rib, we were hungry but not that hungry. Mac and cheese was creamy, potatoe salad seasoned well, pork rib meat was fall off the bone, chopped beef is sandwich worthy, brisket soft and juicy, and the jalapeño sausage... doesn\\'t get much better! Overall excellent dining experience with some of the best bbq you\\'ll find anywhere. Definitely recommend going on a day when they are not as  packed so you can enjoy the experience and food more. Authentic Texas BBQ.  The bark on the brisket is to die for.   I also had a beef rib.  Be careful one beef rib can cost about $20.  \\n\\nThe sides were a little less than expected but this place is not about the sides.  It\\'s about the meat and i will never forget that bark.  \\n\\nGet brisket and be happy. This was our first time to the area. I googled BBQ restaurants in the area and checked the reviews and Terry Blacks had great reviews. We arrived about 12:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon. The line was just inside the doors. While waiting we were offered choice of drink while we wait. They asked us if we were first time diners and gave us some of their favorite choices. When we got to the front of the line we were given an overview of way things were done, starting with the sides. When we got to the counter, the guys cutting the meat explained the options and how they were priced. The choices of meat is there in front of you  so you know what you are getting. The appearance of the meat was 2nd only to the taste, wow, we were blown away, it was meat heaven. We look forward to our next visit to Terry Blacks Great bbq, always busy but the line moves pretty fast and even tho there\\'s always a packed house we haven\\'t had trouble finding an open table, the workers cleaning the tables always help us find an open table too which is nice. Great moist BBQ in traditional Texas style, no yankee influences! The taste needs no sauce! Get sidedishs \"Like and comment on this review if you find it helpful.\"\\n\\nEvery time I come to Austin this place is a MUST! I got my usual beef rib, Flintstone size, and brisket. The meat is always high quality and seasoned to perfection. While I don\\'t need the bbq sauce, the original and sweet ones are my favorite. \\n\\nThe sides are their biggest area for improvement. The rice is great but the mac and cheese is watery with little seasoning. The green beans could have been cooked a little longer but not horrible. The dessert do there job but I have had better. \\n\\nOverall, the BBQ restaurant gets four stars.  5 for the meat and 3 for the sides. The brisket here is absolutely amazing. I\\'ve been to all of the BBQ spots in Austin and the moist brisket here is extremely tough to beat. Turkey is great, everything is great. Would highly recommended. Thankfully, we were recommended this place by a local Austinian while we were at the Riverwalk in San Antonio. This was probably the best bbq food we\\'ve ever had and has the coolest way to order. You grab your tray, and go through the line and get what you want. Ever single thing we had from the sides to the meat was out of the park delicious. Super cool atmosphere and fun place. We even took the \"pit tour.\" My hubby was like a kid in a candy shop! Definitely gotta make a point of going here if you\\'re visiting! I\\'ve tried a lot of BBQ while growing up in Texas, including the menus offered in Lockhart. Terry Blacks is definitely on my top 3. Like a lot of BBQ it\\'s a bit expensive if ordering by the pound. I suggest getting a sliced or chopped sandwich, they will pack it full and you won\\'t leave hungry. Ditch the sides, the come in little self serve 5 oz cups witch aren\\'t worth the $2.25 price point. Whatever the reviews say is true. The place is amazing. It\\'s a cafeteria style for sides and you pick the meat at checkout.  Banana pudding is excellent. Moist brisket melted in my mouth and the cornbread, while rather large, was really good. Go stand in line and love this food. The price was really good for two people and a lot of sides. Brisket is the best I\\'ve ever had!!! Worth the line. Ambiance is also super inviting and laid back! I had a giant beef rib here and it was fantastic. Nice and fatty, great rub, done just perfectly. The couple of side I had were also solid. The only downside to the beef rib is that unless you have someone with you to share, you don\\'t get to try other things because that one portion is so huge. I will definitely return and work my way through the other items, though it\\'s going to be pretty tough not to have another beef rib. That was the best barbeque I\\'ve had in my entire life. To be fair, I\\'m from the West Coast, so maybe this was just my first experience with legit Texas or Southern BBQ, but that was amazing! The brisket just melts in your mouth and the seasonings are incredible. The sandwiches are huge. The sausage was delicious. The Mac and cheese is extra cheesy. The potato salad was good and creamy. The staff are super friendly. I just might go back every night we\\'re in town. It\\'s that good! Writing this in a food coma so bare with me. Come wearing your stretchy pants because you will want to eat everything. FINALLY a bbq place that knows how to do the meats AND the sides. The potato salad and cream corn was delectable. My husband gave the Mac and cheese 5 stars and he\\'s very picky. Of course the cow rib compared to the original Black\\'s, but Terry Black\\'s has everything right with the tender juicy turkey, chopped, brisket, sausage EVERYTHING was to die for. We are pretty sure this is what heaven taste like. Solid Q.  Rarely is there a very long wait.  Jalepeno sausage was great.  Brisket was decent, a little dry. Very good green beans and potato salad. Great beer and wine selection. Different vibe than some of the other Austin cult places. Best BBQ I\\'ve ever had IN MY LIFE! This place definitely is the epitome of good, Texas BBQ. \\n\\nWe came at around 11:30am on a weekday and we had no wait! We ordered burnt ends, brisket, pork ribs, and a beef rib. We also got sides of creamed corn and mac n cheese. The best meats were definitely the beef rib and the burnt ends! Burnt ends literally taste like carmelized candy, so don\\'t miss out on them!\\n\\nWe also got a banana pudding that was simple, delicious, but a tad sweet. The bread is self serve, so load up your place with as much bread as needed to soak up the BBQ sauce and the cream corn. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in Austin, this is a must! Love love love this place. The line was a little long, but while I had a friend wait in line I was able to explore the room which had the smokers. The men who worked the smokers were very friendly and explained the bbqing steps thoroughly. The food was awesome and I love how they have such a huge variety of local beers. I wish I was able to bring back the bbq sauce. unwashed able to enjoy the rub with my husband once i got back. The staff and owner was very friendly. Mark I hope we can meet up when you came and visit our here in LA!!! When thinking of real bbq there really is nothing else that comes to mind.\\nFrom the convenience  of how the restaurant is set up-which is kind of cafeteria lunch style you pick what you want and take a seat to how delicious everything was \\nI can\\'t wait to come back!!!! \\n\\nTruthfully everything I tried was filled with such great flavors. \\nThe side sauces were also amazing I never go for sauce with my bbq but it added a nice kick! \\n\\nThe margarita were amazing as well! \\n\\nUpon arrival I had no idea how big the beef rib was thankfully one of the employees reassured me that it would be quite a challenge to finish three (reference photo below) Great, great barbecue! I Heard about this place and decided to try it since I came here. The food was excellent. I had sausage, moist brisket, green beans, and mac & cheese. For dessert we had some corn bread. It was very buttery and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place if you visit Austin! Best brisket ever! The original and sweet sauces were great with it. We also highly enjoyed the green beans, mac & cheese, and cornbread. Would pass on the pinto beans, kinda plain. Ate inside and the ambiance was cozy. Had to try Texas BBQ when in town, and this is the spot! Awesome brisket!! The pork ribs are the best I ever taste so far, they just fall out of the bone. Environment is familiar, with a good size patio. You do have to make a line and wait a while, but it move fast. We were outside when we arrive and we wait around 30min in line. Had lunch here to day. Forgot to take a picture because I was in the zone. The brisket \"moist\" was fantastic. Soft and tender. Had a giant beef rib. Delicious!! Turkey was juicy and flavorful. Pork ribs were tender. Great flavor. The star of the show was the jalapeño cheese sausage. The best of all the meats. \\n\\nSide dishes: Mac and cheese was just Ok. Green beans were fantastic. Beans were decent. Cole slaw was great. Rice was not that good at all. The jalapeño corn bread was sweet and good flavor. Only problem it was served cold. Warm it up and you have a big hit. My daughter loved the banana pudding. \\n\\nThis place was clean and the staff was extremely helpful and nice. I have eatin barbeque all of the state in Texas and this place is definitely in my top three. I will definitely be back. Terry Black\\'s is my go to whenever I have girlfriends visiting from California.  I used to wait in two hour lines at Franklin\\'s a decade ago, but I feel like their brisket hasn\\'t been as consistently juicy as word got out. \\n\\nI\\'ve been to Terry Black\\'s twice now,  and their brisket is always fatty and juicy.  I like their barbecue sauce more than Franklin\\'s, there\\'s better parking, no wait during the weekdays, and they don\\'t sell out after 2 p.m. One pound of brisket plus one side cost around $29.\\n\\nThere\\'s also an adorable eighty year old gentleman who works there and is an expert at taking guest photos. Wonderful customer service and my friends felt welcomed. We came here on a Saturday night around 8pm and waited for over an hour in line.  There was probably 30-40 groups in front of us and the line does move.  We had to wait in the back where they smoke the BBQ.  \\n\\nIt was well worth the wait.  Once you get near the front entrance, they have a window where you can order drinks while you wait just a little longer.  Once in the door, there is still a line before you make your way to ordering the sides and the BBQ.\\n\\nWe ordered 5oz of green beans, Mac and cheese, cole slaw, and Mexican rice.  We also got peach cobbler and banana pudding.  For the BBQ, we ordered 1/4 lb of sausage, 1/2 of brisket, one beef ribs, and a brisket sandwich.  All of this came to $80.  We thoroughly enjoyed all of the sides and BBQ.  We\\'re Texas BBQ noobs so we only have nice things to say about this place. Amazing ! A must place for anyone visiting Austin!  The meat melts before even getting to your mouth. The side salads were also tasty. Nice customer service! Very reasonable prices! Brisket was excellent. Moist, tender and not overwhelming in terms of smoke. The sausage missed the mark in my opinion, something missing for my personal taste. Pork ribs were tender, and decent although I wasnt wowed. Chopped beef was very flavorful and thankfully not dry. Impressed the green beans weren\\'t overcooked , and the mac & cheese was good if not great. Banana pudding was disappointing. Fabulous, first timer and it did not disappoint despite the 1hour wait to get our food.  We devoured it so quickly, amazing flavor and the peach cobbler was fantastic.  WILL GO BACK! The Brisket literally was dissolving in my fork before I could even eat it. The Jalapeño Cheddar Sausage and Pork Ribs were amazing. Got some of the last Pork Ribs there are like literally with no effort you can just pull the bone out, no force necessary. Wow!! This was my first introduction to Texas bbq after moving here from Arizona. Let me tell you - it didn\\'t disappoint! From the meats to the sides, everything here is amazing and worth every penny My Husband and I were in Austin TX for couple of days, we heard Terry Blacks BBQ was Awesome!!!!!!\\nAbsolutely Incredible!!!!!\\nBest Brisket we have ever had!!!!!\\nSide dishes were very Tasty, Mac and Cheese and Greens\\nPhenomenal BBQ\\nTHANKS\\nMIKE & Patti from St. Louis MO\\n\\nalso Loved the workers out grilling and smoking the Incredible Meats\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlove Pretty good BBQ. We enjoyed it. Great location near the Parmer Event center. We were able to walk over after going to the home show. We got pork ribs, brisket, and sausage. All was excellent, but the brisket was our favorite. The ribs were a bit too fatty and had a lot of rub, so had a nice kick. Mexican rice and beans were delicious. What a win for a BBQ fan!  We loved Terry Black\\'s BBQ!  Up there with the top BBQ places we\\'ve visited in TX.  It\\'s a little pricey.  (Check the big board for meat prices before you let your teenagers order.  One massive beef rib was like $23.)\\n\\nThe brisket was on point.  Turkey was delicious.  We loved all of the sides.  \\n\\n(One suggestion : with the current health crisis, I\\'d like to see them not throw all of the plastic utensils in open boxes.  Watching people lick their fingers & then stick their hands into the box with hundreds of utensils isn\\'t very sanitary under normal circumstances.) Someone claimed their party was getting food but they were clearly saving seats when they should not have been. Rules are the building blocks for a society worth participating in; flouting them and squatting at tables without food is rude and also disastrous for the future of our country. \\n\\nI should\\'ve asked what part of the beef is chopped for chopped beef. Incredible BBQ - both the meat and sides. We split the small family pack and added a 1/2 pound of meat, there were 5 of us (2 girls, 3 guys) and we were VERY stuffed. The turkey was for sure a dark horse and I\\'d highly recommend it, so tender it melts in your mouth. Best brisket we\\'ve ever had! Jalapeño cheddar sausage was also very good. Stubbled on this place. Great discovery! Awesome food and atmosphere. Be wary when ordering sodes; they are family portions,  not individual. Would have been nice to order several different smaller portions instead of the larger single item. When we first walked in here I was thinking it was a gimmick BBQ joint that was all looks and no substance but was gladly mistaken.  The BBQ is out of this world and you don\\'t have to stand in line for hours to find out everything is gone.  For the record, I do love the original Black\\'s in Lockhart but Terry definitely took a great heritage and amped it up for everyone to enjoy.  In all honesty, the secret is in the rub and the slow roasting - the sauces themselves are somewhat incidental but still make a nice addition.  I sent bottles of the rubs to a dear friend back in SF who damn well knows her q and she called to let me know that outside of her secret rub, this was awesome and she and her husband were looking forward to gorging themselves at Terry\\'s.  We\\'ve been back many times - usually as a reward for spending a few hours on the awful concrete floor at the Palmer for the Citywide Garage Sale - and just love the place! Brisket is on point. Husband loved it!!! The original bbq sauce was decent...better than most. We have tried many bbq places and this one by far had the best brisket and their deserts were pretty good! They are on the pricey side so bring the platinum card! Can\\'t wait to go there again our next trip to Austin, TX. Oh and we really enjoyed watching the gentleman slicing our meat right in front of us. He did it in a way as if he really cared. Lol Give then a try you won\\'t be disappointed. One con! The parking lot is too small! Absolutely unbelievable!  We had the beef rib, moist brisket, jalapeño & cheese sausage, cole slaw, mac and cheese, green beans, potato salad, and peach cobbler. The beef rib alone was the best tasting meat I\\'ve ever had.  All of the sides were outstanding. We spent a lot of money eating here, and waited in line about 40 minutes, but it was more than worth it. Will definitely be back next time we are in Austin. Wonderful!  Spent a decade looking for the best barbeque joint.   Terry Blacks is it!  The GOLD standard. Delicious Beef.  My fav is the slice beef sandwich.   Which would be better if meat was not like warm. Love the atmosphere.  Parking can be\\nDifficult. The beef brisket was so soft and delicious. The price was reasonable too. Came to know about their cooking process through the pit tour. The person over there explained it so well and answered all our questions patiently. Great fatty brisket and macaroni and cheese as side. File into restaurant cafeteria style and you select sides and meats. Brisket can be lean or fatty based on your taste preference. The atmosphere is nice and casual. Music nice. The staff were courteous and friendly. I even asked the meat server to chop my brisket because I wear braces. He did it without hesitation. Meats well seasoned and tender. Glad I looked at review from Zagat. Much success with your business. OMG!!!!  How did it take me 4 years of living in Texas before ever finding this place?!  If you try nothing else...make sure to get the Beef Rib!!!!  You might be thinking...wait...$18 for one rib?  Yes!  And it is worth every stinking penny!\\n\\nThe flavor...the fall off the bone meat that just melts in your mouth!  Again OMG!!!  I seriously can\\'t get enough!\\n\\nNow, everything is good!  The coleslaw is some of the best I\\'ve ever had...the jalapeño Corn Bread is on the money...and the mac and cheese is kid tested and mom approved!\\n\\nJust go!  Make sure you put in Terry Blacks...not Blacks into your GPS!  It will take you to another BBQ place in Austin.  And while I\\'ve never eaten there...I can\\'t imagine anything better than Terry Blacks!  And I\\'ve tried a lot of BBQ places in Texas and other Southern States.\\n\\nEnjoy...and you\\'re welcome in advance! A worthy place for barbecue in Austin where the competition is tough Terry Black stands tall Ya\\'ll, this was my first time in TX and my first experience with TX BBQ and I couldn\\'t believe how delicious everything was! The brisket sandwich was stuffed to the brim with meat. It was seasoned perfectly, moist and the flavor was out of this world. Definitely get it with the onions, pickles and sauce. I have never had pickles with BBQ but it was perfect!\\n\\nThe sides were bomb. We had the green beans, mac and cheese and creamed corn. All were absolutely delicious.\\n\\nWe topped it all off with the banana cream pie. Delicious ending to a delicious meal. I can\\'t wait to go back to Austin again and visit! OMG I\\'ve heard about Terry Blacks but being a north-sider it wasn\\'t as easy to get down in this area. But! My family was in town and I wanted to take them to a well known and highly rated BBQ place. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and I saw the line was just out the door. The line moves pretty quick since they have so many stations and registers, it\\'s very well thought out and efficient.\\n\\nWe got to the side dish area and ordered a bunch and then up to the register/meats. The three of us ordered brisket, couple of beef ribs, sausages, and a ton of sides. Drinks, utensils, bread, and condiments are off to the side and it\\'s self serve. \\n\\nIt\\'s a fairly large restaurant with plenty of seating inside and out, workers are attentive to clean tables so there\\'s a quick turn around, and daaaaammn the food was amazing! This is a great place to take for out of town guests or if you just want some good BBQ. I had their pork ribs and sausage bc everything else was sold out. Brisket is what Texas bbq is know for and I didn\\'t try theirs, so please take that into consideration. No wait and was able to get it after lunch hours. These two items easily compete with franklins, la bbq, and is way better than Rudy\\'s.  Their ribs are overpriced, but probably the best I\\'ve had in Austin. I like their side selection more than the other big names around town.  I really want to try the brisket now.  The sauces aren\\'t needed, but they were great, too. Best BBQ place I\\'ve had thus far.  My husband and I tried the beef ribs, pork ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage, moist brisket, and sides of cream corn, green beans and potato salad. All of them are incredibly tasty!  Make sure to come hungry and don\\'t order too much of one particular meat if you want to try out a variety of options.  The line is long but moves really quickly.  Will definitely come back! I ordered the beef ribs, pricey but worth it. It was so good. I also had the pork ribs, brisket and turkey and they were alright. The peach cobbler was amazing. Went here for the first time today to celebrate my husband\\'s bd. We LOVED it & decided it\\'s our favorite BBQ in town! Between all of us we tried pork ribs, beef ribs, sausage, brisket, sides, & dessert. Meat was tender & full of flavor. Service was perfect. We can\\'t wait to go back! What a pleasure.  There is always a line, but feel free to step up to the window and buy a beverage while you wait.  The smell of post oak embers smoking an amazing array of meat makes the wait completely bearable. \\nThe brisket was perfect. That\\'s all I need to say. The service is friendly, efficient and eager to please.  I certainly feel comfortable \"highly recommending\" this place. Arrived late, so the ribs were gone - but our big group absolutely inhaled the brisket. They were from all over South America and this was their introduction to Texas BBQ. Wow wow and wow!!! I\\'m so glad we got this recommendation to try this place while we are on vacation! So good!!! Best BBQ! This place is hands down the best in Texas! I love their ribs!!! They did short us on 1lb of meat but it was a Friday night and they were slammed. Expensive mistake but the food was still amazing My husband says the beef rib here is the best bbq he\\'s had in Texas. It is gigantic, and will make you feel like a powerful caveman. \\n\\nThe seasoning here is top notch. My favorite kind of bbq is the bbq you don\\'t need any sauce to eat - the meat speaks for itself, and that is the case at Black\\'s. I love the brisket, and the proximity to all that Barton Springs has to offer means it\\'s a great choice while you\\'re out and about. \\n\\nThey can produce quite a line but in my experience it has always been pretty quick. Sides are not super memorable, and sausage isn\\'t my #1 favorite, but nothing you eat here will make you frown. Recommended by a friend, lots to say about Terry\\'s BBQ.\\n\\nJust go try it and see for yourself. Only had beef rib and brisket.  Delicious. Seating. Good for kids. AC. One of the only bbq establishments where you can eat great bbq and have a comfortable place to sit. A must try when in Austin, this was recommended to us by a local retail store employee. We heard the buzz about \"franklins\" but didn\\'t want the long line. This food was AMAZING and I\\'m not even a big bbq/meat eater! Reminds me of middle school cafeteria lunch lines but line moves quick and you can pick whatever sides/meat you want! Yum I had turkey and brisket, my friends had the ribs which they raved about. It\\'s a little messy eating on a tray but worth it ! Came to Austin on business and decided to try this place out after an Uber driver recommended to me. So glad I did! I was never a big fan of BBQ brisket because the ones I had (ahem... in the LA area) were just okay. Some were too dry for my taste. Well, my view has changed. I love how they ask you what cut you wanted and they sliced the brisket right there in front of you! So I asked the lady what she would recommend and she suggested the middle section of the brisket which was her favorite part. Where there\\'s a nice balance of lean meat with fat. After taking a bite of the brisket, all I can say is...WOW. I\\'ve never had brisket so tender that it melted in my mouth until trying the brisket here. The ribs were just as tender and delicious! Anyway, I\\'m a BBQ brisket fan now, thanks to Terry Black\\'s Barbeque! I make it a point to stop through every time I\\'m in Austin. The moist beef brisket melts in your mouth and is seasoned generously. The pork ribs are a generous size & fall right off the bone. First time in Austin for a long weekend. A friend back home recommended this place.  It was everything I expected and more. Mouth-watering BBQ, excellent sides, friendly staff. I never thought a BBQ place could be so good. I hope to be back someday. Ask for the pit tour if you go. It was really interesting to see how the magic happens. If you go here you MUST try the Mac and cheese. I was never a huge fan of Mac and cheese but this Mac and cheese is from the gods. Everything here is so delicious! I traveled with a large group so we just ordered just about everything on the menu! The sausages were delicious, brisket was soft and tender! Splash that in their bbq sauce, soooo good! The best side is their corn in cream.  Also, the mac and cheese can\\'t go wrong especially if you have kids.  We had a ton of food, but little left overs.  That\\'s how good it is! Definitely going back if I\\'m in Austin. This was the first Texas bbq we\\'ve tried and we are hooked! Get ready for the meat sweats and leaving feeling like you\\'re going to burst. It\\'s amazing. Wonderful brisket, ribs, sausage, and the chopped beef is delicious too. There is always a line but we\\'ve never waited longer than 30 minutes and you get to drink in line while you wait. Gluten free friendly. This is very good barbecue but there\\'s so many great places in the area that it\\'s really tough to choose among them all.  They have great ribs and good sides as well. Ridiculous BBQ. I\\'m a beef rib guy, and used to portions like County Line\\'s \"Big Daddy\" plate, so when a friend took me here, I ordered two ribs without looking. \"Dude,\" my friend said, \"that\\'s over three pounds of meat!\"\\n\\nYowza. So I ordered a 1/2-lb of moist and a rib, and it was about as much as I could eat. Both were succulent, flavorful and smoky. Sauce added only a bit to the experience, mostly because I didn\\'t want to muddle the taste of the meat itself.\\n\\nPot sal was good: right level of pickles and mayo. The beans were similarly de rigueur but, frankly, I was settling into a meat coma by then.\\n\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the location (core downtown just S of the river), I\\'d be there often, but the mere thought of parking will keep me away evenings and weekdays. Terry Black\\'s is one of my favorite barbecue restaurants around town, and that\\'s a high bar considering how many options area available in Austin.\\n\\nA summary of what they offer include:\\n1. Order spirited beverages while you wait in line (The line moves extremely quickly, so don\\'t be deterred even if you see a crowd of folks outside)\\n2. Unlimited Toppings station for bread, onions, pickles on the side\\n3. A wide variety of sauces from non-spicy to spicy, non-tangy / non-peppery to tangy / peppery\\n4. Delicious meats, typically available all throughout the day (unlike some of the spots around town that don\\'t mind running out before noon and thus aren\\'t nearly as accessible)\\n\\nAs with any barbecue location, brisket is a staple and Terry Black\\'s does it well. I\\'m personally also a huge fan of the turkey for those who like the bird, but you really can\\'t go wrong with any of the meats or sides.\\n\\nThere\\'s a decent amount of parking, although the place does fill out for dinner so it might require some hustling to get a spot. Spacious inside + nice patio outside for Summer nights. Simply amazing! Best BBQ I have ever had! Highly recommend the Burnt End, Jalapeño Sausage and Potato Salad! But honestly, everything is great so doesn\\'t matter what you get I am typically not a fan of BBQ, but Terry Black\\'s sold me! I came here on a Sunday afternoon and the line was a ~20 minute wait, which is not bad compared to what I\\'ve heard from others. The serving style is cafeteria style, so you grab whatever you like. I am very glad with the combo of items I got. Although the sides are very simple, they compliment the meats so well. The meat was so tender and smooth, it melted right in my mouth! It was cooked very delicately yet the seasoning was simple. I loved the hot sauce that was on the table with it. Terry Black\\'s has converted me into a BBQ fan!!! This place is a secret jem! It\\'s a total hole in the wall, but trust me--it\\'s worth the trip. If you go, make sure to ask for their own BBQ sauce. It\\'s a little spicy but it\\'s good. Also, their hot links are out of this world. Highly...highly recommend!!! This place is pretty good. Brisket was fire. One minor thing, one of the employees got upset because we took the inside sauces outside. Hell of a bbq. Wow. Worth the wait. There will be line but just wait, it does move fast and you can get a beer while you wait in line ! The sliced brisket is the best thing there. So juicy! Get a lean peace! Now the ribs just melt off the bone but be careful with a lot of chewy fat. The sides to get are creamed corn, Mac n cheese, potato salad and coleslaw. The beans were okay. And explore all the hot sauces on the table! So good! I stopped in while I was in Austin for work and let me day that it was well worth the wait. The staff was friendly and the food was AWESOME!! I cant wait until I return! Oh man I had been craving some good brisket and finally got some. The green beans were so delicious probably one of the better green beans ..and the corn! Yum!!!! Their bbq sauce could be a little better though .. and watch out their lines can be out of line lol.. they\\'re also a little more expensive than usual places I cannot say enough about this bbq. Went there on a lunch hour and was impressed the rest of the day... also sleepy lol. After a travelimg way too many times to TX, I finally had a beef rib and it was HUGE. Perfectly cooked with the right amount of spice. Im from Iowa so I expect sauce with my bbq.... and this needed no sauce it was so good. I\\'d highly recommend to anyone coming to the Austin area. Delicious. I came for a trip to Austin and this is such a great place for BBQ. It\\'s pricey but it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nI like the beef rib. with the ORIGINAL SAUCE \\nMac and Cheese is AMAZING best I ever had.\\nCold slaw is very yummy and the cobbler and the corn of cream. To drink the sweet tea and árbol palmer was my favorite or just water with lime lol....!! Everything is super good!!! Texas style BBQ.  Excellent choices.  It also has large selections of wine and beer.  One of the cashiers was very nice to let us try out the items that we did not order. Fantastic BBQ, and one of the defaults when we have an out-of-town visitor craving some local Texas flavors. Their fatty brisket is divine and proper. The smoked turkey, while it varies day by day, is always satisfying and delicious. Though the line may appear intimidating, like any good Texas BBQ, they keep it moving. Gives you a moment to salivate before they slice the meat in front of you and give you precisely the amount you desire.\\n\\nDon\\'t know how to order by weight? Just get a half pound of meat and one side. That\\'s enough for most folks with a little extra for a midnight snack. The absolute best beef ribs my boyfriend and I have ever had. We ordered 1 beef rib (because it\\'s HUGE), 4 slices of brisket, and 4 pork ribs. It was way too much food for the two of us, but we were happy. Everything was delicious, but the beef rib was so incredible that my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The meat fell right off the bone. I highly recommend going to to his spot! Great barbecue. Fast service. Meat is a little spendy but so is any good bbq joint. Sides are great and affordable. Nice patio seating! Ok, ok, ok it was worth the wait! We came on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm on 4th of July weekend. We waited outside for about 40 minutes and inside for about 20 minutes. It\\'s pretty shaded so the heat is not too bad! Although, someone did have a heat stroke while in line requiring EMS to be called. So, be careful and stay properly hydrated!!\\n\\nThe brisket is the best I have ever had!! Tender and perfectly seasoned to the point that no sauce is required. Turkey is also moist and delicious. Also had Mac and cheese, green beans and pinto beans all of which were excellent. \\n\\nSo, all in all, I would highly recommend. Parking is tricky but if you are lucky you will find a spot in the small lot. We came here with a group of friends from out of town who wanted Texas bbq, but didn\\'t want to wait in line at Killens.  We tried the brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs and jalepeno sausages, creamed corn and Mac and cheese. Our friends were happy and their bbq craving was fulfilled! This is hands down the best barbeque I have had in a long time. The wait was a bit long but not unbearable, but that just proved that the restaurant is worth the hype and the service is fast enough to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. The sides were self-serve buffet style, I definitely recommend the Mac and Cheese, beans, potato salad, and cornbread. I also had the Beef bone, which is indeed huge. The beef on the beef bone was fall off the bone and so easy to bite into. I shared a beef bone and 1/4 lbs brisket. I was very hungry when I came into the restaurant, and that was definitely enough meat for 2 people. The only issue I had was parking for the restaurant. Hopefully, in the future they can expand the parking to accommodate the high volume of customers. Terry Blacks doesn\\'t get the attention that some of the most famous barbecue places in Austin do. Because of this, the lines are minimal, and you can decide last minute on a weekday evening to head on over. \\n\\nThe brisket is exquisite. Moist, flavorful, juicy. \\nThe Mac and cheese is equally delicious. They also have a great selection of hot and BBQ sauces. \\n\\nOverall a great source of quality barbecue for those who can\\'t afford to stand in line all morning Very delicious, you have to try the corn, amazing! Everything we had here was great. I wanted more but it was so filling and such generous portions. Visiting from phx. Delicious! Brisket and sausage was 5 star. Had the 2 meat and 2 side combo. Line was long, but went quick. This was the absolute best BBQ I have ever experienced. Legit. YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE.\\n\\nLet\\'s just say that I could see myself living in Austin just so I could have this for dinner/lunch/random meat craving. I got a rib and one link of jalapeno cheddar sausage. I thought maybe I could eat that in one sitting, however it ended up lasting three days.\\n\\nCan I just say it was still just as good cold the next day as it was the first day? Unbelievable.\\n\\nI was sad because they were out of avocado sides. I got over it after the first bite. The brisket and t corn cream are to die for!!! Will definitely be back next time I\\'m in Austin. All in all this place is a good place to eat some of the best barbecue friendly staff it is a little too pricey but the food is delicious highly recommend Best in Austin! Worth the line. Skip the hype of Franklins and enjoy equal or greater quality at Terry Blacks. BBQ is good the only problem is there is no sign in or out in the parking lot is desperate Very good! I\\'m visiting town for a conference and we went here for dinner. It\\'s kinda a loud chaotic place when you first walk in, but I got my bearings and was able to figure out the system. We got sides, meat and drinks for 4 all under $75. Which is really good for the amount we got. This place is under rated. The pork ribs was the bomb! The burnt ends was the bomb! Sides were good and the beer was cold. What more does one want? Never understood the fervor for Texas BBQ...but this was EASILY the Best Brisket I\\'ve ever had! Sides and desserts were fantastic too, hope y\\'all expand to other states some day! Outstanding BBQ that was the best I\\'ve had in my life. Would recommend to every friend who visits Austin. Favorite meat was the brisket. Second was the ribs because of the pepper on top. Best side was the cornbread, an absolutely steal at just $1. Grab some Shiner Ruby Redbird and enjoy! Love this spot. Will not forget this exquisitely flavored meal. 5/5 This place might be the able to break the hex on this doomed restaurant location (this must be the fifth restaurant in the last ten years here).\\n\\nThe lunch special runs around $11 and is plenty to fill you up. The brisket was damn good - unless you\\'re some snobby connoisseur who thinks that you need to drive six hours to some rural market, wait in line, and know a secret password to prove how Texan you are - then you\\'ll have have your fix satisfied by Terry Black\\'s.\\n\\nThey did a nice job overhauling the interior to make it flow for BBQ. The pit in the parking lot is kind of cool to check out too, and the guys working it were friendly to onlookers.\\n\\nI don\\'t think comparing BBQ joints is all that helpful, I just want to know if a place is worth my time or not. This one goes in the yes column for me, both on food and location. The best BBQ in Austin! Better than Franklins and La Barbeque. We came around 11:30 and only waited about 30 mins or so. You get to pick the sides first and then the meats. You can order the meats by 1/3 lb, 1/2 lb, etc. My god everything was so good! The meats were all consistently tender and good. We had sausage, brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, beef rib. The creamed corn, Mac n cheese, and coleslaw were bomb too! Baked beans was ok. I like the original bbq sauce out of the 3 sauces. If you didn\\'t order enough meat to eat, you don\\'t have to go back in line to get more. Not sure if people are suppose to clean up after themselves, but the staff came and took away our garbage. Saw a big group left a lot of food leftover and all their trash on the table. What a waste of good food! There\\'s also beers cans and bottles if you want beer with your bbq. We didn\\'t see any beers that were interesting to try with our meal. Great and faservice! I was visiting Austin for the first time and what is better than eating BBQ in Texas?! Terry Black\\'s has the best brisket I\\'ve ever had. It melts apart and in your mouth. The dry rub has amazing flavor and the smoke ring is beautiful. I had the Mac n cheese and coleslaw for sides. The Mac n cheese was ok, but I wouldn\\'t get it again. The coleslaw was good since it was not drenched in sauce. I\\'m still giving 5 stars because the brisket is why you go there and it was absolutely amazing. I definitely recommend Terry Black\\'s next time you\\'re in Austin! Amazing bbq.. crazy inexpensive unless you order a beef rib and then it turns into fine dining but well worth it .. a Austin institution for a reason and a line-up our the door. this place is crazy expensive BUT well worth it!! absolutely delicious [we had the chopped beef, turkey, bean, green beans, mac \\'n cheese & peach cobbler] we will definitely come back if we\\'re ever in austin!! I\\'ve yet to review this place, so here it is.\\n\\nI think Terry Black\\'s has the full package. Not only are the meat options top notch, full of flavor, juicy, smokey, crisp, but the sides are to die for.\\n\\nWe\\'ve tried, and love:\\n-meat: brisket, sausage (regular), turkey breast, pork ribs (meat just falls off the bone - juicy and delicious).\\n\\n-sides: Mac-N-Cheese (All day!), best crispy string beans, spanish rice (the BOMB).\\n\\nNeed a little sweetness, or something to kick up the heat a little, Corn-bread muffins are delicious, and a side of jalapeños will do the trick.\\n\\nLastly, just what every meal needs, is a great drink to go with it. TBB\\'s doesn\\'t stop short of providing such a WIDE VARIETY of drinks. Me personally, as an avid coca-cola fan, the sweetness to carbonation ratio they use on their soda machine is set to PERFECTION! Coke? YES PLEASE!\\n\\nThank you Terry Black\\'s, and I\\'m looking forward to taking all of my California guests here when they visit, that\\'s of course once they\\'re confirmed as COVID-free. :) Amazing ribs and brisket. The meats are so juicy and tender they just melt in your mouth. The vinegary BBQ sauce pairs nicely with the smokey flavor. The smokers are repurposed propane tanks and they smoke their meat with post oak and pecan wood. 250 degrees for 16 hours makes some pretty amazing brisket. The sides are great as well and there is plenty of cold, local beer. This is a close second to Franklin BBQ and nowhere near as crowded. Meat is sold by weight. Tried the beef rib...oooohhh yeah.  A little more bark than I am used to on my bbq, but I liked it.  I also snuck a piece of brisket off of my buddies plate (after I distracted him).  I\\'m a fan of the brisket too.  I\\'d recommend this place to someone who is visiting from out of town.  Good overall atmosphere and really good bbq. Spent $62 on BBQ. The one beef rib was $40 and worth every penny. Long line. Moved fast. Well worth the long wait!\\nThe sausage had a great mix of the typical smoky flavor along with the kick from the jalapeños and a nice balance with the cheese\\nDefinitely go for the moist brisket over the lean brisket, incredibly rich and flavorful\\nOut of all the sides I think the Mexican rice stands out the most, but can\\'t really go wrong with any of them depending on your taste Down-home, Texas BBQ! Amazing brisket -both the lean and the moist were perfectly smoked and fork-cutting tender. The pork rib bones were falling out of the meat as they were trying to cut us our portion. They were also perfectly cooked.  We tried all of the BBQ sauces, each was different, we all had our favorites. The mac and cheese and cream corn were fantastic, too. Prepare to be full for hours after going here, but well worth the trip and wait! The jalapeño sausage, brisket, ribs, and sides were amazing. Make sure to grab a mini pecan pie for dessert! This is Texas BBQ. It really doesn\\'t get much better than this. \\n\\nWe balled out on this one - $65 got us \\n\\n- A huge 1.6 lb beef rib\\n-Half a pound of Brisket\\n-2 links of sausage \\n- mac and cheese \\n-potato salad \\n-banana pudding\\n-creamed corn\\n\\nI have had Franklin\\'s about 5 times now and I gotta tell you, Terry Black\\'s is just as good if not slightly better. The sides are amazing, the sausage and brisket are a home run, and the whole experience just feels so quintessentially Texas. This, Franklin\\'s, and Leroy&Lewis has got to be the best BBQ in town. You can\\'t go wrong with anything here. \\n\\nNext time, I am gonna hit the sausage and brisket with some corn and beans and call it a day, went a little overboard on our first day but everything was SO GOOD. \\n\\nArmadillo Art Bazaar + Terry Black\\'s = a perfect rainy Austin december day. Pretty good food overall.\\nAs a first-time eater, the process was not intuitive.  \\n\\nI ordered a couple of sides and eventually got some meat.  Even when I explained it was my first time, it was tough to coax info out of the workers.  All that will pass as anyone will have an easier time on the second trip.\\n\\nThe food:\\n2 sides - coleslaw and mac and cheese.  Good size portions and pretty tasty.\\nMeat - brisket and ribs.  I ordered too much and have some leftover.  Not a bad thing, but since there is no guidance on what \"a meal\" looks like, you just end up answering questions and getting too much food.  $26 later (before tip), I had dinner for 1, without a drink.  \\n\\nBrisket was great.  (Will get again)\\nPork ribs were so-so.  (Will skip next time)\\n\\n(Frequent traveler exploring his new home) Loooooong line.   Fast service.  Great barbecue.  \\n\\nSo I feel a bit embarrassed to say this, but yes, I standard in line for 45 minutes so I can have the pleasure of tasting their famous barbecue.   Standing in line is against my religion.  So no matter how good it is, I cannot give them a 5 Star.   However,  when I finally got to order and eat my food,  I was amazed from how delicious it was and how tender my beef ribs were.   It takes skill to make good beef ribs because some places have pieces that are very fatty.   It wasn\\'t the case here.  The pieces were perfectly cool, and were not too lean but not too fatty.   I will be going back there for a second round in a few months when I go back to Austin. The wait is not too bad here. There\\'s plenty of seating here and they have 2-3 cut masters here so the line goes pretty fast.\\n\\nWe ordered the pork ribs and the brisket. The brisket was not as tender as Franklin\\'s but I liked the rub wasn\\'t overly salty and that their bbq sauces were more on the sweet side, just like I like it. The pork ribs were tender and fall off the bone. We also ordered the creamed corn and cornbread. The creamed corn was delicious while the cornbread had great flavor but was a tad dry. \\n\\nOverall, great experience here! I would come here if you\\'re not willing to wait in long lines elsewhere. First time to Terry Black\\'s with some friends and this might be one of the BBQ places in Austin!\\n\\nWe got some moist briskets (pretty thick and fatty), turkey (flavorful), but the highlight was the beef ribs. It was so tasty and soft--literally fell off the bone. The beef rib was very impressive.\\n\\nWe also did some rough calculations, and it came out to be $17 per rib (1+ lb though).\\n\\nThe sides were fairly good. All above average but nothing outstanding.\\n\\nThe service was good and place was clean, pleasant and spacious.\\n\\nDefinitely going back there again! Now this is some of the best bbq I\\'ve had. This is what I expect for Texas bbq! I can\\'t eat beef but my wife had the beef ribs and said while they were a bit fatty the taste was good. The pork ribs were good a bit sweet for me but the rest of my family enjoyed them. Now the turkey was moist, flavorful and I ate this for two separate meals! The max and cheese was awesome and my family said the beers and rice weren\\'t bad. The atmosphere is as inviting and cool. The ability to get what you needed was good. I felt for the size another drink station could be used so as not to get backed up. The staff were friendly and helpful. The place is rustic, or rundown, depending on your outlook. Giant beef ribs, jalapeño and regular sausage they have them all along with moist and lean true Texas brisket. This is some of the best BBQ that I have come across in my lifetime.\\nThis was some really good BBQ, brisket very moist- beef ribs were tender,big and meaty. Sauce was good too, not that it is not needed when meat is smoked perfectly like here .The salad, beans,coleslaw and peach cobbler were all got a homemade feeling and taste and all tasted great.\\nThe line moves slowly, but the wait worth once you get the food. It\\'s not super modern fancy, but if you want excellent examples of great Texas BBQ , this is the place to go. I\\'ve tried it all and it is all good . From the ribs , brisket to his custom made sausage , it\\'s some of the best. Great brisket and ribs. My husband and I agreed these were the best we\\'ve ever had! Dog friendly on the patio. I visited during the lunch time and found a special between 11-2pm. But, the portion of meat was merely a quarter, so I chose a brisket sandwich hoping for full stacks of meat in between buns. I was asked to choose either moist or lean part, and I took moist. The sandwich was packed with thick, juicy, extra moist briskets... plus onions, pickle, bbq sauce. It tasted so goood... You won\\'t regret it. GET A BRISKET SANDWICH!! Fantastic!! Loved the turkey sandwich, couldn\\'t get enough of the brisket, and it fell apart perfectly onto the Mac n cheese. Great beer selection and delicious corn bread. Yum... they rated really well, and they delivered.  I got to try most all of their dishes as part of a large corporate party, the BBQ beef ribs were simply amazing.  I had no idea beef ribs could be so tasty.  I will definitely come back here when I can.  In the mean time, I\\'ll just have to dream about those ribs anytime someone mentions the word BBQ in the future. Popular BBQ spot with meats and sides served cafeteria style. As a vegetarian, I tagged along with my brothers as they wanted to experience Austin BBQ. While they enjoyed their brisket, there were also many solid vegetarian sides and desserts. We all split the mac and cheese, cream corn, green beans, corn bread, and peach cobbler. I especially liked the mac and cheese and cornbread. Overall, I would recommend Terry Black\\'s for BBQ while in Austin, especially given the vegetarian options (seemed other BBQ spots didn\\'t have quite the same selection). \\n\\nNote: there was a lengthy line to get food on a Sunday during dinner time, but the line moved rather quick. One of the best bbq spots I have ever been. Brisket and beef ribs were amazing. Like any Texas style bbq meat counter, first timers can easily over order and end up with a whopping bill after you get a little of everything. One of my top 3 bbq places in Austin. Love their meat and sauce but the sides are what keep me coming back . Unreal. The meat literally just fell off the bone of our 1.5 lb beef rib. The sides were amazing. Can\\'t say enough good things about the corn. I probably could\\'ve eaten the whole pint by myself. The atmosphere was casual and fun as was the staff. Their sauces were delicious, but totally unneeded! My husband got to take a \"pit tour\" out back and see where all the action happens. Great spot! Feed me brisket and tell me I\\'m pretty! As a self-proclaimed barbecue connoisseur this place is wonderful! The line moved very quickly, the sides were all phenomenal, and the meat... oh the meat... DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin and looking for that famous Texas barbecue. Had the opportunity to eat here with my family and hands down from the service to the food it was fast and delicious.Dont be intimidated by the line because service is fast!!!! This is the best BBQ place my wife and I have ever tried. We tried the brisket, Turkey, jalapeno sausage and the pork ribs.  Everything was excellent to include the sides.  We arrived before 6pm and then the rush arrived. Brisket was extremely good. Very tender, you could easily cut it with a fork. Only disadvantage was it had more fat than actual meat. :) Sadly, Franklin\\'s BBQ was closed but fortunately Terry Black\\'s was open & their Bbq, service and ambiance deserves not 5 but 10 Stars! We ordered their brisket sandwich, coleslaw & bbq bakes beans. I\\'ve lived in TX for over a decade & I am a diehard TX. Bbq faattie. Ya\\'ll gotta go get some!!! OMG not much to say other than EVERYTHING was fantastic! My absolutely favorite will have to be the pork ribs though. I\\'ve never had pork so tender, flavorful and that effortlessly fell off the bone. Sad I don\\'t live in TX but if I visit again I\\'ll be back!!! Our hotel attendant claimed Terry Black\\'s was the best BBQ in Austin.  We gave it a shot ordering the brisket, pork ribs, and links.   The brisket was cooked perfectly with a beautiful pepper and salt crust.  The meat had a nice smoke ring too it, with good flavor and moisture.  Everything else was tasty, but fell short to the brisket.   Overall, a nice casual restaurant with fair prices and solid Texas BBQ. O. M. G. I thought I\\'ve had good BBQ before but I was this puts them all to shame. Texas knows how to do it right (Terry Black especially)! \\n\\nI was recommended to combine the beef + cheddar jalepeno sausage in my sandwich and it was so. dang. good. The sides were amazing as well. I would note that the sandwich combo only comes with one side and a drink. The sides come first, so I didn\\'t realize that and got two unknowing what was in a meal. No regrets though. The green beans are deliciously fresh and the Mac & cheese is creamy cheesy perfection. \\n\\nI came for lunch around 1 on a Tuesday. And while it was definitely hoppin\\', there was no line. The staff was super friendly (& gave great recommendations to boot)! Definitely a *must* while in Austin. I\\'m from Kansas City and we pride ourselves for the best bbq. I\\'ve been looking for a decent bbq place for 6 years in Texas and Terry Black\\'s was the best I\\'ve had in Texas. Their briskets were the best I\\'ve had. We also had the beef ribs, pork ribs, and jalapeno sausage. Their rub is what makes their BBQ so good. Their line was long but it goes quick! Mac and cheese, green beans, two slices of turkey, vinegar sauce.  \\n\\nI think this is solid BBQ. The brisket can be way too salty on some days (but perfect and delicious on others) so I stick with the turkey now. \\n\\nThe only downside is the insane line during big events. Come during off hours and you\\'ll breeze through. Good QUE! \\n\\nThought we would try this while in Austin instead of driving to Lockhart. Glad we did.\\n\\n2pm in the afternoon and the place was still packed which is a good sign for me.\\n\\nI tried all the meats and they were all good. The jalapeño sausage was just okay but the brisket, ribs and Turkey were great.\\n\\nGood smoke flavor, seasoned well BBQ,they are representing the Black family well. This place has some tasty BBQ!! As soon as you walk in, there is a line. You would order first and then find a place to sit with your tray of bbq goodness.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered three sides: mac and cheese, coleslaw and cream corn. For meats, we got the pork ribs, brisket and two different sausages. You just tell the butcher the weight or number of pieces of each kind of meat you want.\\n\\n\\nEverything was so good! My favorite is the pork ribs and brisket. It was so moist and had good flavor! Best brisket I ever had!  I knew when I first arrived this place would be awesome. Stepping out of the car I was literally bombarded by the magnificent and mouthwatering aroma permeating the air. Yes it was crowded and I had to stand in line for several minutes, but that is just proof of how good the food is! This review is specific to the brisket which is among the best that I\\'ve ever had. My friends come here often said that the brisket is what they they do best. I ordered it moist and it did not disappoint. This is exactly what comes to mind when thinking of Texas barbecue. Inside it was very similar to other BBQ joints in Texas. You grab some sides, drinks, and then order your meat. Come hungry. This place is (tied) number 1 on my barbecue list. There are a lot of great BBQ places in Austin and I\\'ve been to many of the \"top 10\". The people who work here are always friendly and willing to help make suggestions. The brisket, please do the right thing and get moist, is some of the best bark I\\'ve had. Perfect bark, super juicy, and the fat just dissolves when you chew. The jalapeño cheddar sausage does not disappoint. Most places don\\'t add enough jalapeño or cheddar but not here. You taste it in every bite. The pork ribs are also amazing. I prefer baby backs, but these are flavored perfect and are so tender the bone pulls out clean! The prize here is the beef rib. One is almost too much for one person (when you have all the other meats on your plate). The beef rib isn\\'t cheap but you get what you pay for. The beef rib is one of those things that you \"mmmmm\" and shake your head in amazement during every bite. I\\'d talk about the sides but really?  You\\'re here for the meat! I went on a Monday evening and the overall experience was excellent! Everyone was super friendly and I was immediately greeted when I entered the restaurant.\\nI had the brisket--which was delicious! I\\'m not sure why everyone keeps commenting about the lack of flavor? I also had the pork ribs and they were full of flavor as well. In regard to the sides, I had the Mac and Cheese and cream of corn--both were actually made homestyle and VERY tasty.  I will definitely return here in the future! One of my favorite BBQ places that I have tried in Austin. I have visited here on multiple occasions (Thursday late afternoon, and a Saturday night). Most of the time there is a line, and limited parking so my friends and I always uber. All of their menu items are absolutely fantastic and savory. The BBQ sauces on the table taste great, but you barely need them with their well cooked food. Ribs fall off the bone, and their brisket is magical (my favorite). They have a decent canned beer selection (no tap) for Austin (I\\'m from Wisconsin = high standards) with local selections. Service was friendly, informative, and there was enough seating with a great view of downtown Austin. For sure will visit again. Best barbecue I have ever had, the meat was so tender, the ribs literally fell off the bone. I would definitely recommend getting the brisket and ribs along with the Mac and cheese. Great BBQ!!! Well seasoned meats and good flavor. Got the Lean Brisket, Sausage, Mac & Cheese, and green beans. If I ever come to Austin, Tx again, this place will be my go to place for Real Texas BBQ. Highly recommend it for people who want to get BBQ in Austin. Believe it or not I\\'ve never been a huge fan of barbecue or brisket and now I know why...I had never been to Terry Black\\'s Barbecue. The brisket was incredibly flavorful and so tender. The awesome thing is, now I\\'m a HUGE fan and still thinking about this place! The bad thing is I live in So Cal and the bar has been set way too high. I fear I won\\'t find another place that will even come close. I want to go back to Austin just to eat here again. \\nI was with 5 other people on a girls trip and we all took bites of different sides. Mac and cheese, coleslaw, green beans, creamed corn, cornbread as well as banana pudding, peach cobbler and pecan pie.  It was all delicious!! I will be back and I will recommend this place to anyone headed to or near Austin. Amazing!!!! So I\\'m visiting from California so my standards for bbq aren\\'t too high because we have decent bbq spots. This spot though is amazing. The brisket, beef rib, sausage and all the sides are just super good. The meat is so tender and well seasoned.  I will definitely fly back to Austin to eat here again. First time ever in Austin and first time ever having real BBQ. My boyfriend ordered to pick up the first night, it was sooo good that we had to come back next day for lunch. The BBQ smoke as well as smell permeates throughout the entire parking lot. The brisket was perfection on a plate. Amazing!!! Everything was on point. \\nYou definitely have to check this place out!! Omg. Yhe best bbq in town...family owned.  Great people.  Most of all. They really care and take care of you.....as a ubar driver ....i take alot people here......so please go....ITS THE BEST THERE IS...THX MIKE AND TERRY This Beef Rib yo... This is what dreams are made of, thanks for this amazing experience. We just moved here and we will be eating here often! Hands down our favorite bbq place.  Come early since a lot of the ribs are sold out! We visited Terry Blacks on during our wkend trip to Austin. The brisket is by far the BEST we\\'ve ever tasted. The brisket literally melts in your mouth! I give a very solid 4 stars for the food, service and atmosphere. As always, the brisket, beef ribs and sausage were on point. Tender, juicy, flavorful burnt ends that make me wanna slap your mama. I\\'d never slap MY mama.\\n\\nThe green beans were perfect. Hovering in that place between crisp and tender (a hard feat for a dish kept in a steam table)  with the right hit of onion. \\n\\nThe wait was about 30 minutes. And entirely worth it. \\n\\nBut can we talk about the hot guy running the register that looks like Bradley Cooper? I got pregnant just looking at him...FIVE STARS... I came here not expecting too much but left incredibly amazed by how amazing the food was! First and foremost GET THE BRISKET!! It literally melts in your mouth and is the best brisket I\\'ve ever had!! The sides are decent and the sauces they have to offer are delicious as well! The restaurant itself was very cute and welcoming and all the staff were super friendly and helpful!! They were extremely accommodating of large groups and made sure we were taken care of!! Amazing service and excellent food, you can\\'t get much better than this! One of our go-to BBQ places in Austin. We bring visitors here all the time because the quality is great and consistent! The dinning room is large and there is rarely a long line (especially during the week). They have plenty of parking too. The brisket is always good and the sausages are great. They have many different sides that are served cafeteria style so you can choose your serving size. (Personally I love the green beans!) Great place for families and kids as well. 2 key items, beef rib and sausage. both have good smoke and the meat is moist and tender. the pork shoulder is great as well. Although everyone raves about the brisket and the brisket is quite flavorful,...... even the more fatty one is dry.  beef should always be medium to medium rare.... yes it can be done with smoked meats..... but seldom in bbq restaurants.  What a waste of good smoke.  overall, very good bbq joint and worth the 1hr. wait. This is one of my favorite places in Austin!!\\nThis place is so good. I brought my patents here from Indiana and they loved it .\\nThey are back home now and have been there for about a month and have constantly asked about this place every single day!!\\nThe food is ready good and reasonably priced.\\nThey said when they come back, this will be their first stop. Even before seeing me.\\u200d best beef rib ever.  worth the money to try it.  brisket also good.   everything else on par with most other places around. Let me start by saying I am NOT a barbecue person. I don\\'t ever crave it, nor do I eat much of it when someone invites me out for barbecue. Terry Blacks has made me a convert. The meat was so tender and flavorful! The cornbread the perfect combination of sweet and spicy with the addition of jalapeño. I loved the creaminess of the Mac and cheese and the price was right on point. We sat at picnic style tables and enjoyed our meal amongst other Austinites. I loved everything I had here and will be coming back every time I am in Austin! One of the best BBQ in town hands down. I love to eat and I am a bonafide meat guy. I have been around and the meats here great. Hands down the best meal I had while visiting Austin. Everything was AMAZING. My favorite was the beef rib on bone, which easily fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. The Mac & Cheese was out of this world! And the banana pudding was the best I\\'ve ever had.. super light, not too sweet, and just straight DELICIOUS. So good we went twice in a weekend! This is easily the best BBQ I\\'ve had in my life.\\n\\nMust get: beef brisket, pork ribs. The fattier the brisket the better (if you can handle the richness). The better sides were: cole slaw, creamed corn, and coleslaw. Would skip the green beans - they were limp and way too salty.\\n\\nFor comparison, we also tried La Barbecue which was personally a disappointment and I found that it was overpriced for what it is. Terry Black\\'s barbecue was definitely a highlight for me in Texas! I would 100% recommend this bbq joint to anyone looking for delicious bbq without a ridiculous wait.  I had another place I wanted to try but couldn\\'t stand the wait with the kiddos.  I also tried another bbq place and I think Terry\\'s was way better!!!! Must try the pork ribs, Mac and cheese, and creamed corn!  Everything was tasty and service was good. The pork ribs were flavorful, tender and fall off the bone.  Texas really knows how to do bbq. I wish I could have it again!  Please go try this place!  I\\'ll be dreaming of this food!!!! Just came here yesterday with a friend from\\nOut of town. They wanted Franklins but of course waiting in line for 6 hours with the possibility you might not get what you went for isn\\'t appealing. There was a line at T Blacks but the line moved quickly. Everything from the potato salad to the sausage to the brisket to the pulled beef sandwich was incredible. Their sauces are amazing as well. Had leftovers and for everything we got, $60 wasn\\'t bad for the huge pile of food we had. Being from San Diego, CA it\\'s always been on my bucket list to come and eat some Texas BBQ. Amazing barbecue, line moves fast and there\\'s plenty of seating. Come before the crowd so you can get your bbq quickly. We ordered beef rib, beef brisket, jalapeño cheddar sausage sandwich, pecan pie, mac and cheese, and green beans. My favorite was the jalapeño cheddar sausage sandwich, so flavorful and the best sausage I have ever had. The sides were also delicious, but I would pass on the pecan pie for another dessert. The beef rib was tender with a delicious salty crust. Favorite part was tearing each piece off and trying the variety of homemade bbq sauce they had available. The brisket was also great. The restaurant itself seems like a tourist trap but the food is absolutely great. When you are finally done ordering the sides, you get to pick your bbq and the butcher cuts it in front of you, which is really cool. Definitely recommend this place. Mouth watering brisket that\\'s pit smoked for at least 14 hours. Their jalapeño and cheese sausage is really good. My husband had their beef rib and he says it was all that and then some. \\n\\nFood is served cafeteria style with sides at $1.98. Their desserts looked yummy, bit it was all about the meat on this visit. You\\'re given the option of juicy or lean brisket so it\\'s totally up to you which you\\'re wanting. First: preorder. The definition of a pre order here is that they will cut up your meat and have it in a tray at your reservation time.\\n\\nWe got the beef ribs and brisket here. The brisket here was much better than the one at la bbq imo. It was much more tender and fatty.\\n\\nLa barbecue has much better beef ribs though. The ones here were just as tender, but I thought the flavoring and smokiness wasn\\'t quite as strong and addicting as the other one. I still very much enjoyed it though!\\n\\nAlso there were free sides like pickles and bread here, was a nice touch. An even better touch? You can go look at the smokers outside and see all the meet inside!\\n\\nI would recommend this to anyone. I know Franklin\\'s is the place, but having this and not franklins is not blasphemy. Some of the best brisket I\\'ve ever had! They have a great system down with the way their lunch line is set up. Well worth the money. The food is delicious and the wait isn\\'t awful! We decided the line at Franklins is unbearable and heard amazing things about Terry\\'s and everyone was spot on. We probably waited about half an hour during the noon rush and the line moves pretty quick. It\\'s deli style - you order your sides first and then pick your meat and checkout at the same time. The beef rib was moist, tender, and perfectly seasonable. One rib to share is more than enough for two - maybe even three. The brisket was equally melt in your mouth. My favorite sides was the coleslaw and corn cheese. I saw a lot of people buying lbs of takeout and I wish I did the same! The food was great. Make sure you are hungry when you go. The beef rib is very large. Best brisket and Mac and cheese I\\'ve ever had in Texas. Blacks never fails to satisfy your Tatar\\'s buds. Line sometimes can get a little long but it\\'s worth every single second. Best BBQ in Texas in my opinion and I truly love great quality food. SO good but annoying lines. The brisket was OUTSTANDING and our favorite. We also had the turkey which was good. We loved the Mac and cheese also! Sadly the corn bread was too dry for our liking. All in all this was great and really glad we had a chance to try it. Be prepared to wait at any time of the day though :(. Wow this place is awesome!! I am from Miami, FL where the food is international and awesome...but I have never had barbeque like this. It was soo tender and delicious. I ordered a mix of the brisket, pork ribs, and new to me smoked turkey. I didn\\'t know turkey could be that moist in any form. The people working there were professional and polite. This is a down home place the ambiance is super relaxed. Great experience. Probably the best bbq I\\'ve ever had.  Very long line but the wait for the beed brisket, cream corn, mac and cheese and corn bread was well worth it. Damn good stuff and it\\'s great having a BBQ joint from Lockhart, Taylor, etc. up in \"the big city\" Austin. Try the location on Guadalupe too. DE-LICIOUS. Not a huge BBQ person but came here with some friends, I\\'m so glad I did the brisket which is all I tried was AMAZING, and so were the sides, I had the green beens and Cole slaw. \\n\\nGet there early long lines form quickly, but they also go fast ! For never coming here, and not knowing anything about the area this is a 5 star place. My uber driver recommended it, and it\\'s worth coming!\\n\\nFrom the street corner you can smell the food and its inviting as hell to come in.  Upon walking in your greeted and explained how it works.\\n\\nYour in line for about 5 minutes, and while your inline you can choose your bottled beverage, open it, consume 1 or 2 and pick your sides. As the line moves and your sides are picked you get to the register and pay for your meal, the butcher is cutting and preparing your meat choices in front of you. \\n\\nThe meat is smoked on average for 15 hours before serving it. \\n\\nWe chose the family meal for $95. It was delicious. The rib meat fell off the bone, the brisket melted like butter in your mouth. The sausage was juicy and full of flavor. The mac n cheese was to die for. \\n\\nHands down one of the best places to eat at Vsiitng from Seattle and not a huge meat lover. We stopped in here at my husband\\'s request and ended up enjoying the best damn barbecue I\\'ve ever experienced. Must. Go. Back. Terry Blacks is awesome.  The food is great.  Brisket and pork ribs are our faves.  There are tons of BBQ spots in Austin but Terry Blacks is one of the best.  And unlike some of the other favorites like Franklins and La BBQ, which are also great, you can still have Brisket and Ribs at Terry Blacks after 2pm when those other spots purposely run out. \\n\\nThe wait can get long but it is worth it. I got here at 11am Sunday, right when they opened. All the meats were good. I tried the brisket, turkey, pork ribs, jalapeño sausage. The pork ribs have a sweetness to them, new experience for me but I liked it. The two sauces I tried were both great. Don\\'t bother with the sides, everything was mediocre at best. The wait was long but the food was delicious. I got the pork ribs and they we\\'re falling off the bone they were cooked so perfectly. I also got their peach cobbler which I can\\'t recommend enough it was so good. I\\'m walking away from this meal stuffed and satisfied although we waited 45 min in line, this place was SO WORTH IT. the meat was perfectly cooked and the sides were amazing. 5/5 stars for sure. Best brisket ever.  Sadly they had run out of ribs by 7.  Come hungry leave full and happy. Thanks I really can\\'t understand people comparing Rudys to this place. Rudys is a commercial abomination to Texas BBQ. I tried this place because I had to see how similar to was to the original Blacks BBQ in Lockhart. Let me say upfront that this place doesnt come close to the original Blacks. But considering some people dont have the time or luxury to travel out, its still a good option. \\n\\nIf you get the sausage, order the traditional. The jalapeno cheddar sounds amazing, but the cheese took away from the flavor IMO. The fatty brisket was great. They do a really good job with their spare ribs. I didnt try the sides, since I wanted room just for the meats. They offer a nice variety of sauces. I like that they didnt load up the tradtional sauce with too much pepper (like at the original Blacks). \\n\\nI would highly recommend everyone to go to the original Black\\'s in Lockhart. If this is not possible, then this place still is a great option. The brisket at this place was so tender and moist, I just needed to look at for the meat to come away from the fat. Extremely tasty, perfectly seasoned and smoked, you can\\'t go wrong. \\n\\nLots of seating, indoors and out. Be prepared to stand in a bit of a line, but while you\\'re waiting, prepare those tastebuds. \\n\\nI had borracho beans, creamed corn, and slaw, with banana pudding, 1/3 brisket and sausage and had leftovers. Keep in mind good bbq is pricey, but also, good bbq is worth it. Came to town for some Texas BBQ and it was fantastic - had to try all of my favorites. Hope my hotel has a microwave bcuz my leftovers are coming home with me! I recently catered with Terry\\'s Blacks for my wedding at Zilker Park. They were the best! Excellent communication from start to finish, professional service the day of and, last but not least, absolutely DELICIOUS bbq. We got so many compliments from our guests about how good the food was, they all asked for the name so they could go back! If you\\'re planning an event, you should hire them...a definite crowd pleaser! Always the best. Sausage tastes like what sausage should be (jalapeno and cheese is my fave), brisket is always tender (lean or moist, we usually get a mix) and turkey breast is always tasty and moist. Not to mention the cobbler is so good. Also, they accept Apple Pay! Lifesaver, when my daughter decided to move all my credit cards. Always our go to for out of town guests! We took my family here over the holidays (12/22/18) and it was super busy.  We waited in a line that stretched outside for about 45 minutes.  Service is always relatively quick.  We did a little bit of everything- beef brisket,beef ribs, pork ribs, sausage, green beans,slaw, peach cobbler, rice. My family oooh and awwwh over the BBQ heavenliness of the meal.  It was a huge win for Ilya and that is all they talked about for the remainder of their stay.  Thanks T Black\\'s for making our picky, choosy family  happy! This is the best bbq I\\'ve ever had in my life. I think I tried 3 popular bbq places while I was in Austin for 5 days, and although they were all very good, Terry Black\\'s was easily my favorite. The rub, tenderness, flavor - everything was on point. Mac and cheese, beans, and corn were all very good. \\n\\nPortions are huge. Our group of 10 or 12 people managed to order way too much food. In all of our excitement, we overlooked the family-size combo, which would\\'ve been a better value. This is the real deal, traditional Texas bbq. Big smoker shack outside and big piles of silver oak wood. Inside is somewhat over the top on the Texas decorations but visitors from out of town expect that. The smell is intoxicating.\\n\\nThe motto here is Brisket is King. Yes, they do pork ribs and other stuff but this is why you come here. The smoking is heavy, and rub seasoning is aggressive on salt and black pepper which is traditional in flavor profile. However the meat is very juicy, even the Burnt Ends which are my favorite. You will want to ask for slices from all over the brisket to get a good representative sample as the cut is not uniform, and I would taste it before adding sauce which is on the side. I personally like mixing sweet sauce with one of the spicy hot sauces to bring it all into balance. Delicious brisket!  Everything I\\'ve had is good, but my hands down favorites are the fatty brisket, with potato salad on the side.  \\n\\nThe green beans are a great side choice, as well.  The other sides are kinda blah, so stick to the classic tater salad/brisket combo and you will not be disappointed.\\n\\nBonus: Sandy\\'s next door serves delicious frozen custard cones that are a perfect follow up to bbq. Ah TB\\'s. Maybe not as good as it gets but damn good nonetheless. Good prices for good meat. Skip the sides that aren\\'t veggies though. Go for the brisket and pork, the bread, and the pickles, etc. A lit less of a wait and you\\'ll enjoy yourself more overall than dome places. Also better than the chains, so it\\'s the perfect happy median. From drop off to food in my mouth in less than 35 minutes.\\n\\nThere is a window to buy beverages from while still in line outside. Don\\'t go to Austin and eat BBQ from a place with no line.\\n\\nCheck out the photos. Simple instructions. Simple delicious food.\\n\\nBeef rib ~ $25/rib?! It was AMAZING and I would do it again if I find myself at this establishment again.\\n\\nEverything pictured was finished in one sitting. Best pork ribs I\\'ve ever had! I came for the first time on a Thursday night around 6 and it was not super crowded. The restaurant is cafeteria style so you get to choose your sides first and they get served on a tray and then you continue walking to the bbq counter where you order and they serve you right away. Once you have your food you can walk over to their condiment section where there is bbq sauce and also white bread! \\n\\nWe ordered a pint of the mac n cheese, banana pudding, pork ribs, and brisket. The MAC N CHEESE! I really loved it! I will definitely be ordering it everytime I come here! All of the food was so delicious! The pork ribs were so tender and seasoned perfectly. The meat was literally falling off the bone. The brisket was super tender and perfect with their signature bbq sauce. \\n\\nThe food is worth the parking situation. We got lucky with a spot when someone left, but on a busier night it could be really difficult to find a spot. I highly recommend coming here! I will be back again and again! Had the brisket and sausage. Brisket was incredible, the perfect flavor and just fell apart. Sausage was good, but would recommend going with something else like the ribs instead. The BBQ sauce was good, but I prefer the sauce at cooper\\'s because it\\'s a vinegar base and I love that tang. Now if I could just combine cooper\\'s sauce with black\\'s brisket - perfection. Our company\\'s WeWork office is just down the street so we visit this quite often. It\\'s as good as any other BBQ place in town! Expect a 15-30 minute wait during lunch hours M-F. Can\\'t go wrong with any of the menu items. Go as a group and try a little of everything. Don\\'t forget the pudding! Best damn bbq in the heart of atx. Better sides than most places. Their mac and cheese and creamed corn are so great. Lots of cold beer selections to choose from when you walk in. Special occasion type pricing that you\\'ll never regret paying. So damn good I\\'d consider getting it two times(max)per week. Great Texas BBQ. Beef ribs were on point. Brisket checked off all the boxes. Sausages were great. Line moves quick and service is friendly. Makes one appreciate their consistency for a larger customer base. Awesome BBQ establishment!!! You get your money\\'s worth and then some. I highly recommend this BBQ place. Large portions so be ready to take some home and leave stuffed. \\nAs a Rideshare Driver, I always recommend Terry Black\\'s to visitors. And they say, Thank You the recommendation. You are right. Excellent food and we were so stuffed.\" \\nEnjoy! So good. Get the pork ribs, which are among the best in Austin. Also, I appreciate that you can actually get a seat here. Top 3 of all BBQ I have ever eaten. Wish they had more/better (read healthier) sides. Ditto for dessert too. The meats here are nothing short of fabulous though. IMO, the brisket is as good as Franklin\\'s, but without the wait. Franklin\\'s and Angelo\\'s in Fort Worth are my #1 and #2 picks, with Angelo\\'s being #1 more often than not as I live in the DFW area, and the wait is never that bad. Had brisket, pork ribs and jalapeño sausage yesterday for lunch. Held me all day at a COTA event until dinner in Waco. Nice job here Mr. Black!  I will be back no doubt! I waited to write this review so I can try other bbq places first. This is my favorite BBQ place in Austin to date. It was a very heavy meal but completely worth it. Although slightly on the saltier side, the brisket was amazing. It was super juicy and tender. The sausage links are also a must. All the meats did not disappoint. Even my parents loved it! Come early and the lines aren\\'t that bad. We will definitely be back and highly recommend to all friends and family. Visited for the first time and really liked it. \\n\\n-Brisket was great, the sausage was pretty good. \\n-The sauces were all really good\\n-The decor and building and seating was very nice\\n\\nThe best thing though, were the staff. Really friendly and helpful. They made this experience from a 4 star to a 5. Came here 2 years prior. Wasn\\'t that impressed but they did their thang today. Don\\'t see how you could give em less than 5 stars. Got the brisket sausage and ribs. Wasn\\'t too fond of the ribs were a lil too salty for me but they were still good. the cream corn was my favorite out of all of it. The lean brisket wasn\\'t dry and very tasty.  The sausage was also pretty damn good. Their bbq sauce was rockin. Pretty impressive for them to have such a big operation and for the food quality to still be on point. Would definitely come back A few weeks ago I was craving Barbecue, specifically Texas barbecue. Due to my recent craving, I ushered my girlfriend to go on a road trip from our home in Miami to Texas. This morning we set out on a journey to find the best barbecue in Austin. Our search around Austin lead us to many locations, only to find most restaurants were closed due to COVID-19. We finally found Terry Blacks barbecue. I could not have been more excited to sit down with my plate of brisket, pork ribs, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, cornbread and the complementary sides of pickles, onions and 3 incredible barbecue sauces. \\nMy girlfriend didn\\'t believe me when I told her how good Texas barbecue is, Terry Blacks certainly delivered. \\nTo top off all the amazing food, a pit master was kind enough to go out of his way to give us a brief tour of the smokers on the side of the building. \\nIt\\'s too bad Terry Blacks doesn\\'t bring it\\'s talents to South Beach. Maybe soon Was at another bbq establishment about to order bbq but before ordering i started reading the reviews about that place and someone stated that Terry Blacks was a lot better so we instantaneously left that establishment and headed to Terry Blacks. \\n\\nMy family and I were visiting from Louisiana and I never enjoy bbq while doing i got out. Here i felt like i was in my own back yard. I must say I\\'m am very glad we stumbled across Terry Blacks. They have the best Beef Ribs and brisket in Austin. I say that because whenever i return that\\'s a spot i must revisit. \\n\\nThe  brisket Literally  melts in your mouth. I loved the cream corn as well. Macaroni and cheese could use less salt and more black pepper. Cole slaw is good i just like mine sweeter but it\\'s all worth it. I miss this place already Loved this place.   Got there about 11:30.  They have parking and got a space as a patron was leaving.  Waited in line about 10 minutes.  I thought the green beans were awesome, potato salad was good too.  The meats we tried were the sausage, moist brisket, and pork ribs.  All were excellent with a nice smoky taste. Each and every employee was amazingly kind and welcoming. Thank you Terry Blacks for an enjoyable meal and experience. Probably the best BBQ overall that I have had.  The brisket was seasoned throughout, almost like it was brined.  The pork ribs were good, i prefer baby backs but these were great.  No sauce needed.  The atmosphere and place was just about perfect.  The cheddar hottie was the best I have ever had.  The turkey was packed with flavor, I did try some of the hot sauce with this. I have a pretty great photo of my tray if I can figure out how to upload the image and make ya\\'lls mouth water :).  The beans and the slaw stood out, much better than the 6 other BBQ places I visit when in Austin.  I liked the consistency of the frijoles and the overall ordering process.  They pulled a brisket flat out and unwrapped it right in front of me from a 3 story wall of smokers.  I have seen some BBQ in my life and this was overall probably the best.  Will I pass by a Rudy\\'s on any given day?  No.  I will make the trek downtown for Terry Blacks. Good eating! Had sliced beef ,macaroni and ribs. Mmmm!\\nGreat flavor. Ambience was ok. I guess it\\'s a buffet style you look and pick what you want they serve it that was my ahhh moment. Other than that is was good. I stopped by Terry Black\\'s with a few friends while in Austin for New Year\\'s and had a pretty mixed experience. We were able to order basically all of the meats and sides, including the pork ribs, beef ribs, moist brisket, and sausage. All of the meats themselves were incredibly tender and juicy, exactly what I had expected for a well-known Austin BBQ spot. However, we did take a bit of issue with the dry rub on some of the meats, which we thought were much too salty (especially the beef rib) and detracted from the natural taste of the meat. A personal favorite for me were definite the pork ribs, which were sweet and salty and had a firmer texture than the other mostly fall-off-the-bone meats- they provided a nice contrast to the other much more fattier cuts like the brisket and beef rib. All the sides were amazing, and if I were to come back, I\\'d definitely order the brisket and pork rib again, but would likely skip out on the beef rib and sausage. Love their beef rib! Their peach cobbler, their slaw, and jusT about everything! Its a total must if you come to Austin! The brisket is so good, we feel it has the best flavor & the bbq sauces are awesome & they have one for everyone (sweet-tangy, regular or my favorite spicy) Food and staff are excellent. You can tell their folks take pride in the establishment. I would say the turkey was a bit too salty for my taste buds. We got the turkey and brisket sandwiches and they were great! Definitely get the $1 corn bread. Potato salad was good but the Mac and cheese was below par. Green beans also weren\\'t the best. Overall 4/5! The food was amaziiiing! I was visiting my best friend and she took me here for dinner. First of all, the line was through the door around the building so that was a good sign. The smell coming from inside was making me drool. Her boyfriend was the one that ordered for my husband and I. He ordered idevenk how many pounds yes POUNDS of brisket, some sausage, and I already knew what sides I wanted. Everything from cornbread (super moist and flavorful) to potato salad mac n cheese was alright-a little runny. Everything else was great. The meat literally fell off the bone once I bit it. Texas is definitely where the real bbq is at. Will definitely be coming back! Excellent brisquet!!! Fresh brewed sweet tea. ..awesome!!a very friendly atmosphere!short ride from out hotel...was highly recommended and lived up to it\\'s excellent reputation!!! OMG! Thanks to YELP and confirmed by TripAdvisor ince you have Terry Black BBQ you are hooked. I had the brisket sandwich with 1 1/2 pounds of meat. I had the dessert sides, Banana pudding, and peach cobbler. Better than sex. Three types of BBQ sauce to die for. Our fav was the original. My 16 year old son ordered the brisket, pork rib, turkey and pulled pork plus 4 sides. I got one to 2 bites of his. I\\'m spoiled now. No BBQ I eat in California will be good enough now. We came back Thanksgiving eve at 4:30pm and they were already out of almost everything. We were sooo disappointed. We went 2 blocks down the street to another small 70s-80s place recommended by a Texan friend. It was horrible by Terry Black standards. We drove back to Terry Blacks to see if we could at least get dessert at 6:30. A guy outside said \"we\\'ve been closed for an hour\". People pulling in were so angry you could hear every car squeeling their tires as they left. That is how good it is. Hands down the best brisket I\\'ve had in years! Had to stand in line for alittle bit, but you\\'re able to purchase and enjoy a nice beer while you wait. Staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was awesome. Great BBQ without the drive to Lockhart. Missing the nostalgia from the older BBQ joints,however everything was very tasty. The brisket was moist and not too fatty and the sausage was flavorful. The potato salad was a bit mustard-y for my taste. The creamed corn was delicious. The mac & cheese was kind of bland in my opinion. The sides were cafeteria style with options for a serving, pint, or quart. There was a large variety of meats. Service was quick and efficient. We got a lot of recommendation to hit this place up if we were trying not to wait in line for 4hrs for food. What a great place to visit. You get everything you need to have a good BBQ experience and it\\'s all right in front of you. The staff was kind and helpful and the smokers out back were cool to see. We got the 411 and a up close look at the 140 briskest cooking for nearly 8hrs. Great experience and even Better food. The best barbeque we\\'ve ever had! The brisket was extremely tender & tasty. The brisket sandwich, on brioche roll was thee best. A local  find that you\\'ve absolutely got to try! I\\'m a convert to the \"fatty\" brisket.  There\\'s a choice.  Nothing like the richness of marbled brisket.  They do it right. Okay, honestly there should be no reason that a place has such amazing bbq! All around everything was delicious, I almost fell into a food coma after because of the AMAZING banana pudding! I\\'m coming back here every time I visit Austin, the price is worth it! The staff was extremely friendly and helping, the crowd is constant!! Definitely recommend Everything (no joke)! Even the bathroom smells good this place made it to my first pick for bbq! Thanks y\\'all ! I\\'ve found my barbeque heaven at Terry Black\\'s!\\n\\nWe went there a bit before lunch on a weekday and there was no wait. We tried the brisket and pork ribs - both were juicy, tender, moist and well flavored - and would definitely order again in a heartbeat. The sides are in a buffet and they charge by the container size, but we didn\\'t get any to save meat space so don\\'t know how it is. The bread, however, is at the end of the queue after cashier and it\\'s self-serve and free. \\n\\nLots of tables and chairs so it\\'s super easy to grab a spot to hunker down and inhale the best BBQ ever. Best BBQ I\\'ve ever had. Travel to Austin often for work and a coworker recommended Terry Black\\'s. We arrived at 5:00 and waited 45 minutes in line to order. When we left the line way around the building. Those folks will be in line for more than an hour. I can tell you now it\\'s worth the wait. \\n\\nWe had a little of everything and everything was a home run. We had ordered big, intending to take home leftovers. We are every bite. In Austin this is a must!!! The pork ribs were PHENOMENAL. Whatever rub is on there is outstanding, and they were perfectly tender. The green beans were crunchy but steamed to perfection, and with a nice onion/salt seasoning. The brisket was tasty as hell and even came with a burnt end, as seen in the photo. THIS MAC N CHEESE, PEOPLE. Just wow. It didn\\'t look like much, but it was one of the best things on the plate, and that\\'s saying a lot. I will dream about this barbecue until I return to Austin and have it again. I give it 10/10 stars and my heart. Great bbq! Took my cousin there while she was in town. We had a great meal. I would have enjoyed having a bit more service in the dining room keeping it clean. The best beef rib we\\'ve ever tasted and it was huge!!! Everything in Texas is bigger holds true with the ribs!!! Pork ribs were delicious and the brisket melted in our mouths. Loved all the sides and the lone stars topped off the Texas BBQ experience. Best brisket in town. Short lines, great staff, amazing food. Also do yourself a favor and get the cream corn. I am originally from Kansas City which has some of the best BBQ in the nation. I also have my own smoker and have smoked many meats for years. Have also eaten in the Austin area since moving here this year at Saltlick, Rudy\\'s, and Kreuz in Lockhart. Terry Blacks beat them all. The Brisket was as good or better then all, Pork Ribs out of this world, Turkey great, and Sausage as beefy and great tasting as I have had. The sides were all awesome (had beans, slaw, and banana pudding). Have not been to Franklin but can\\'t imagine it being better than Terry Blacks plus no hours long wait.  \\nThe only negative was the under whelming sauce but the meat was so great tasting and tender I didn\\'t feel the need for to much sauce. Great ambiance as well and on our way out we ran into Earl Campbell on the way in! Great experience all around. This place is a gem. Can\\'t wait to go back. Awesome meal. Hands down, best BBQ in Austin!\\n\\nThe brisket and sausages are crazy good, and don\\'t even get me started on the sides! The mac n cheese and peach cobbler are reason enough for me to come back here! Depending on when you visit, the line can be pretty long. I\\'m probably the most impatient person ever so if I\\'m waiting for an hour to eat, you know the food is going to be amazing! \\n\\nThe restaurant is set up cafeteria style. Once you get towards the front of the line, you\\'ll grab a tray and pick your sides (pro-tip: you don\\'t pay by the pound so don\\'t be afraid to give yourself a generous serving. The food here tastes great as leftovers!). When you get to the front of the line, you\\'ll head on over to an available cashier/meat cutter and they\\'ll cut whatever slice of meat you want. Oh man.  This is the best bbq I have ever had.  Pork ribs, brisket, giant beef rib and hot links.  Just fantastic.  The corn bread, mac and cheese as well as the beans were super good also.  The best part is, THEY HAD PLENTY OF BBQ.  Unlike the other place that we waited 2 hours for only to be too far back in line to eat.  Just cut the crap and go here.  It\\'s that good!!! What\\'s there to say.  Amazing BBQ.  Soooo good.  Service was great.  Staff was kind and environment was good.  Super busy but to be expected. My best friend brought me here when I went to visit her. The bbq so so delicious! \\n \\nI got the pork rib and brisket and hot damn the meat was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. You literally see the juices oozing out of the meat.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the bbq sauces too. I tried the OG and it\\'s a little sweet, salty and tangy! \\nI loved it so much, I brought back three pounds of pork ribs and brisket for my loved ones back home. And you know what? They loved it too! My boyfriend ate a whole plate of meat in one sitting.  \\n\\nGo here. You\\'ll be glad you did! Very very very amazing delicious flavorful ribs. We had both beef and pork. They were both amazing. \\nReally nice atmosphere. Lovely place and yummy food. Definitely will come back here. I can\\'t wait to com back and eat again. No photos because I immediately ate my food! We ordered a brisket sandwich and Mac & cheese. Went on a Saturday night so they were out of some side and meat options though. Just shows the popularity :) Here\\'s my review. Look at the pictures. What else do you need to know? The cuts of brisket are huge A must to try location if you\\'re in Austin. Ribs are amazing! Ask for a tour to see how they make the meat. Moist, tender brisket. Sausage was on point. Tried the Mac and cheese and beans, all fresh and tasty. Worth every penny. I\\'ll definitely be coming here more often. If you live in Austin and you haven\\'t been to Terry Black\\'s, you\\'re doing something wrong. If you\\'re visiting Austin and haven\\'t gotten to Terry Black\\'s yet -  grab your keys and head there now. Terry Black\\'s is the ONLY restaurant I am patient enough to wait in a line for. The brisket is to die for, and the sides are insane. Cole slaw with kale and dill? Amazing. Potato salad? Amazing. Mac n cheese? Arguably better than grandma\\'s. Come hungry and try to visit during a non-peak hour so you get to enjoy the atmosphere sans-insanity. This place was recommended to me by a colleague. The cobbler was amazing!  The barbecue is worth the 10 minute wait in line. The sides were just okay and it is a bit on the pricey side but a definite must try. I\\'m not a meat eater. I prefer my fruits, vegetables, carbs, and desserts. You\\'ll rarely see me at a BBQ event because the options are limited for me. However, I was visiting Texas and they are known for BBQ. I will try it at least once, and make my decision based off my newer experiences.  I am super happy I gave them a chance because their BBQ was far superior from any I\\'ve tried. \\n\\nTheir ribs are soft and full of flavor. Their mac and cheese was lit. Cornbread was alright. But whatever meat my boyfriend ordered, I devoured. I\\'m glad we shared because it was pretty expensive for a little plate, but it was worth it, and definitely worth the price. \\n\\nI\\'ll probably only eat BBQ at Texas now. This place is more or less exactly what I\\'d want from a barbecue place. We had the fatty brisket, which was amazing. I enjoyed having the opportunity to self-serve the sides, and the sauce (original was my favorite) was on point. The service was prompt and, for this quality of barbecue, we really didn\\'t wait very long. We were on the early end of lunch, but it was run with impressive efficiency. This would be my go-to spot in Austin. The best brisket I\\'ve ever had  in my life. It\\'s almost like cafeteria style and you can grab a beer in line too. Arrive early before  the lunch hour because it will be packed. Deservedly so! \\n\\nThree of us went in on brisket and muffins, green beans, mashed potatoes, and Mac N Cheese! So much food and all so good. We ate until we about to burst. Seriously, it tastes so good you won\\'t know when to stop eating. A must visit for  any foodie visiting Austin. This place is TEXAS BBQ! The beef ribs were fall off the bone tender and the brisket was 1st class. Had both sausages and the jalapeño cheese was my favorite. Had nice spice to it but not to much jalapeño flavor just enough. The pork ribs were good also. The seasoning they use is so good I had to buy the beef rub and take it back to Cali with me. The line was about 40 min long at 730 pm but it moved pretty good. Terry Blacks is a must stop when going to Austin. so many barbecue places are closed at night or on mondays, but not this place.\\n\\nit was about $15 for 2 huge slices of brisket, 2 sides, and a drink.\\nyou scoop your own sides, i should have thought about this and taken bigger portions. \\nthe mac and cheese was more creamy than baked, but i prefer that so i thought it was great. potato salad was good, but nothing special.\\ni had moist brisket and it was very moist. i like it this way, but it was a little much even for me. i ended up leaving some of the fattier pieces on the plate, so maybe the lean brisket is worth trying here. the flavor was good though and it was very tender. i could have easily only had 1 slice.\\neveryone at my table raved about the mac and cheese, and was happy with everything else they got. plus there was no line and live music. Excellent service and delicious food! The sides were all fantastic and the meat was tender and tasty. I thought the prices were very reasonable, except for the ribs, which ended up weighing more because the bone is so large. I would recommend to anyone travelling through the area looking for Texas BBQ! This place was excellent. The ribs were some of the best I had. I also had some sausage (jalapeño/cheese) and it was fantastic too. I didn\\'t get to try but 1 side - potato salad and it has dill in it, which I like. The rest of the sides looked to be just ok. Went to Terry Blacks for Valentine\\'s Day. Heard great things about this place so my husband and i wanted to check it out since we aren\\'t from the area. Food was great! Alittle pricey but well worth it. I was caught of Gard with how the food is served. First you wait in a long line to get in and then you are served cafeteria style with trays. It\\'s also your responsibility to find your own seat once you have gotten your food. OMG - worth the wait!  We are from out of town and didn\\'t have a car so my original choice was too far of an uber ride.  Walked from downtown Austin over the Congress Bridge to see the bats on the way over to the restaurant. We wandered back to peek at the smokehouse before getting in line and were given a really nice and unexpected tour by one of the owners.  Go early and you can buy a beer at the window while you wait in line.  The BBQ was absolutely delicious and I was convinced to order the sausage in addition to the Brisket which was fantastic and I\\'m so happy I did as it was phenomenal!   They post on the entry door what they are out of so go early especially if your going on a busy weekend night.  I will be back next time I\\'m in Austin Super LEGIT BBQ. Well worth the wait. Just wish i would of tried the Beef Rib. I had burnt end, brisket and the pork ribs and it was all amazing. Had the side of Mac and cheese and it was super cheesy and delicious. Well worth the wait for amazing food. Yum! Be prepared for a line, both outside and inside. Busy all day. But worth the wait.  Great Mac & Cheese! The coleslaw had a little heat to it, which was different and awesome. We tried the Beef Brisket and the Pork Ribs - I\\'d recommend both. We got 1lb of meat for two people, two sides (1pint size and 1single serving) and a dessert.  We were VERY full. BRISKET!! \\n\\nCome here for the Brisket during the day if you want to avoid the long lines of the extra famous places. The brisket here is fantastic, and the brisket sandwich is great if you\\'re ready for a gut-bomb. Though it\\'s not as good, all-around, as some of the other barbecue spots in town, it\\'s still deserving of 5 stars. I\\'m not a BBQ snob but I can tell the difference between good brisket and great brisket. This brisket is great. Maybe not the best, in town, but still great. Ok, I am a BBQ snob, let\\'s get that out on the table. Blacks was.... well, it was pretty good. Ordered a quarter of brisket, a sausage link, cream corn, slaw and a drink. $20, plus tip. Pretty freakin steep if you ask me. Brisket was nicely done, as was the sausage. Nice smoke and flavor, tender but with a nice bite. I like that, fall apart BBQ isn\\'t my thing, it needs to have a little chew to it. Cream corn was a little bland in my opinion, but the slaw was outstanding. 3 sauces on the table, original, spicy and sweet. They were all good, but the original was the ticket for me. All in all, it was a good meal. Thought it was a a little pricy, but not crazy. I would eat there again, especially if someone else was paying. :) This place lives up to the hype! So glad we got there before the dinner rush, the line was literally wrapped around the side, outside the door! Oh and the sides...do NOT skip out of the sides. Black\\'s is just down the street from where I work, making it a great choice when I\\'ve got beef ribs on the brain. In the morning there\\'s barely anyone in line, getting in and out is a quick affair if you\\'re looking to get your food to-go.\\n\\nI generally don\\'t go for sides, but I\\'ve tried them here. The potato salad and mac n\\' cheese are pretty good.\\n\\nBrisket? Excellent. Ribs? Superb. Sauce? Awesome. Wait? Non-existent. There\\'s a lot of great BBQ in Austin (and it\\'s surrounding areas). But when you factor in taste, price, location, convenience, and wait time, TERRY BLACK\\'S IS THE BEST! It\\'s my go-to place to take out-of-towners for some true Texas Brisket! My mouth is watering just typing this review. Terry Blacks BBQ definitely has a place in my life where I can get the best and moistest Turkey ever. I also love the sausage. \\n\\nThe brisket was too oily and salty for me but it looked good.\\n\\nThe Beef Rib was dry and over cooked wish mine was semi perfect. \\n\\nThe peach cobbler tasted sweet and good but I\\'ll prefer the banana pudding to end the day. \\n\\nThey use a low quality white bread that\\'s self serve and not very appealing.\\n\\nThe line moves steady and if you want more meat you walk back to the people who served you and get more without going back in the long waiting line. At first I wanted to go to franklins since it is top rated. But I just didn\\'t want to wait for several hours. A local friend recommend this place. I came during lunch hour on a weekend and I waited about one hour to finally order the food. My group got mac and cheese, potato salad, green beans, creamed corn, and coleslaw for our sides. We ordered beef brisket, and beef ribs. These were the only meats we wanted to try. \\n\\n\\nI first tried the brisket and I was amazed how tender it was. It melts in your mouth! So tender ! The beef ribs were delicious too. I absolutely loved the brisket more. But some of my friends said they like the ribs more. Anyways, both the beef ribs and brisket are delicious. \\n\\nThe sides were all great as well. My favorite was the mac and cheese. It was quite a filling meal with all the meats and sides. But every bite was worth every calorie. Terry\\'s Black\\'s definitely beats the Black\\'s over near campus. I came here to get some brisket and ribs and ended up having a wonderful meal. \\n\\nI got a couple pork ribs, brisket, green beans and Mac and cheese. Ribs were solid, brisket AMAZING, green beans are more tasty than any in all the lands, Mac and cheese was okay. I also had a bite of my buddies corn and that was mind blowing. \\n\\nSpicy bbq sauce is a must and it will bring me back to Texas.\\n\\n-Señor Some damn good barbecue!! We stumbled across this place and immediately fell in love. They cut all the meat right in front of you and you can see the tender and juiciness. Additionally all the sides were scrumptious as well. There is a ton of seating, both indoor and out. But don\\'t wait to come too late into the night. They run out of some of their best stuff! This is an easy place to go (except parking) for good BBQ in Austin. one of my favorites. Texas the Lone Star State, how can I not LOVE the BBQ that your state has created! Extensive search for a Texas BBQ place was very difficult, but we settled on Terry\\'s Black\\'s BBQ because of the Yelp reviews, location and the delicious photos posted. Located right off the street, parking was limited, but easy to find. \\nOur first time in Austin, Texas we did not know what to expect and saw that it was cafeteria style with sides and selected pounds of various meats and sausages. \\nWe walk in and realized they were filming a Food Network show, so we go to see and meet the owners of the place. We ordered so many different meats, sides and tried all of their BBQ sauces. It was ALLLLLLL delicious! I\\'m not sure when I will be back, but this will be a place to visit again and again. We had just had barbeque at the Pecan lodge in Dallas. We thought that was excellent but, when we started our meal, here at terry blacks, our entire thought process about barbeque in Texas changed.  The meats were moust, not over smoked.  The beef rib was tender, fall off the bone, moist, full of flavor and soft texture.  A fine outer rind bit not too tough, not too thick and not dry at all.  I was amaised at how there was lttle to no fat on the brisket.  How do they do that?!  The other meats, brisket, susages and pork ribs, all outstanding.  The price was better than in Dallas as well.  I enjoyed the layout.  Serving your own sides, and plenty of choices.  I now have to return to California.  I am ruined by this experience.  I will return, and WILL experience this again before Idie! No wait for weekday lunch at 1:00. Here\\'s what I got.  \\n\\n5/5 beef ribs\\n5/5 cole slaw\\n5/5 creamed corn\\n4/5 pork ribs\\n4/5 brisket\\n4/5 potato salad My first Texas BBQ experience and it was fantastic. Tip: show up early so you can beat the line that wraps around the side of the building (5:00-5:30) \\n\\nWe got the brisket, sausage, Mac and cheese, cole slaw and baked beans ! \\n\\nThe brisket was our fav as it melted in our mouth. The sausage was good but it was very greasy ! If I came back again I\\'d just get the brisket. The sides were delicious \\n\\nAll food pictured was under 35 bucks ! Absolutely loved it. My son piled on 5 slices of brisket and I grabbed four pork ribs and one sausage. We both had two sides on our plates and with an additional two sides, two sodas, a slice of cornbread and one pecan pie the tab was $54.00. Very good deal considering we had a good amount of leftover for midnight snacking. We chose the fatty brisket and it was fantastic. The ribs were fall off the bone with a great smokey taste. Sausage was ok. Loved  the rice, beans, potato salad but the creamed corn, oh my, I wish I had a gallon of it right now. It was so rich and creamy. Pecan tartlet was good. Definitely not too sweet. It could have been just a tad sweeter for me. The spicy sauce was so good I bought a bottle to take home. Best sausage and best brisket in town! Only hard thing is the parking. We make a special trip in town to eat the bbq. Gosh I absolutely love this place. This is a great bbq joint. I\\'ve had Terry Black\\'s bbq catered here and there before. However, this was the first time I stepped in the store. Its amazing. My mouth was watering as soon as I walked in.  Clean place and great customer service!! I heart beef ribs. Trying out the new Terry Black\\'s today.. The rib was very good, comparable to La Barbecue. The brisket was fine but not outstanding.  I thought the beans were nice and peppery and the potato salad was fine but just not my thing. Overall pretty good. What a perfect experience we had here! EVERYTHING & I mean EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly & attentive. Also, just as a bonus there is a lovely view of the backside of Auditorium Shores. A great spot. We will definitely be back! Great BBQ!! It was a nice day so I sat outside. Loved it!! Gave it a 4 out of 5 because of the birds all around the outdoor seating around. Not sure what they can do about it but I definitely didn\\'t like it. The food is worth the battle with the birds!! Lol Kind of cafeteria style.  Grab your plate and tray, walk to the sides, grab your sides, then off to the BBQ guy.  I ordered the Flinstone size Short Rib.  It was very good, but just too big (especially since you pay by weight).  My wife got the brisket, and that\\'s was good too.\\n\\nIf I go back, I\\'d get the brisket.\\n\\nThe sides were OK. Great meats, the sides are average. It feels like you\\'re in a Hill Country ranch setting - and the Smokey smells are authentic - yet you\\'re a mile from the center of Austin! Great offering of classic barbecue. We shared a beef rib, brisket, potato salad, and Mac n cheese. It was the best barbecue that I\\'ve had in Austin so far. I highly recommend the beef rib. It was super tender yet not mushy. Same with the brisket and both had outstanding bark. \\n\\nThe sides were awesome too. The potato salad was well seasoned. The Mac n cheese was very cheesy and gooey. I\\'d recommend those sides too. They have a wide selection of bottled and canned beers but no drafts. I can\\'t figure out why some people turn their noses up at this place in favor of some of the more boutique-y bbq joints. I still think this place offers probably the best moist - not lean - beef brisket in town. No knife needed here - it just kind of melts when you stick a fork in it. The ribs are also great but I can\\'t really vouch for the other meat since I always get the moist brisket. The sides are also pretty good and the atmosphere is kind of your standard, kitschy Texas-themed bbq joint. Always take out-of-towners here and they\\'ve never been disappointed. Still dreaming of this meal.  I ordered the brisket, green beans, mac n cheese, and cornbread.   The brisket was tender, the sauce was great, and I really really loved the mac n cheese. My friend got a pecan pie that I am pretty sure is my favorite pecan pie I have ever had.  We got there on a sunday around 11am and the line was long, but they move people through very quickly and I don\\'t think we were in line for more than 15 minutes. Just in town from WA. Heard about this from the Thrilist travel blog. The brisket was very good. So was the coleslaw and pecan pie. The table barbeque sauces were very good. Would have given it 5 but the pork ribs were just ok. Bill was about $40 for one. I loved this place. The staff was incredibly nice. The food was delicious. I\\'m told there is another great place in the area but there is usually a line out the door. That does not appeal to me. \\n\\nWe arrived near closing, we bought out their stock and they did not kick us out. It was nice to not feel rushed. We did tip generously as a thank you. The brisket is to die for!!! All the sides are $2.50/PC (5 oz) My husband and I both had the brisket. We filled up a pint size mac-cheese which was $5.99 (better deal). I had the salad & brisket which came with 1/4 lb meat for $9 total. My husband\\'s brisket was ~ $21/lb (he had a 1/2 lb) about $10. Great downtown Austin BBQ. There\\'s definitely better places for brisket, but their BEEF RIBS are second to none. Came here on a Sunday around noon and only had to wait about 25 minutes. I think this was definitely much shorter than others based on the reviews on here, so my experience might be a little different. \\n\\nWe ordered a huge platter of beef ribs, brisket, pork ribs and sides. \\n\\nAfter waiting in line for almost 3 hours at the famous Franklin\\'s, I\\'d say I would prefer Terry Black\\'s just based on the wait time and the comparable quality. \\n\\nIn my opinion, Franklin\\'s is a must-try, but the next time I visit Austin, Terry Black\\'s will be the one on the itinerary. Great place for barbecue because you don\\'t have crazy lines, there\\'s plenty of parking and the barbecue is great! They have a great selection of sides and friendly service.  They have a large indoor seating area and a nice outdoor seating area too.  There is also a decent selection of beer.\\n\\nThe brisket is great, juicy and tender.   The fatty and lean are both great.  They make their own sausages which are also worth trying.  Turkey is also good. I was surprised that the ribs did not have more flavor but they were fall off the bone tender. Last time I was here the green beans were very good. Today they seem to be a little undercooked and cold.  The beans were also very good. The side salad was just OK.\\n\\nThe staff here is very friendly. If you get the chance check out the smokehouse. They will give you a tour. Look. You can go to  Lockhart. You could also stand in line at that other famous BBQ place in Austin. But a short line wait of 20 min gets you some good Hill Country barbecue from the Black family, and you can play miniature golf at Peter Pan\\'s down the road with your leftover time. \\n\\nI would grab a beer while you wait in line. They are up front and you can sneak a peak at the sides which you order before ordering the meats here. When you arrive to the counter go Brisket for sure. \\n\\nPro tip- while someone holds your place in line, take your out-of-towners behind the back and ask for a tour from the pitmaster. Yes this is brisket heaven!!  No I haven\\'t had Franklin\\'s but I\\'ve had la Barbecue and for my money, this is the best brisket ever. La Barbecue was excellent as well and it comes in a close second, but the lean brisket at Terry Black\\'s is exactly what I was hoping for. Also got a bit of history regarding the BBQ brothers here in Austin. After having BBQ here in Austin, I can say I\\'ve had the best anywhere. I think it would be difficult to top BBQ here. A friend told me to try Terry Black\\'s after I\\'d moved to Austin, because nothing\\'s supposed to beat Texas BBQ, right? Maybe, but I thought the pork ribs were my favorite; I was happy to sink my teeth through the crispy surface, and the meat underneath came out rather tender, but not necessarily fallen off the bone on itself, which was great! The brisket, well, was just all right--a bit too salty for me, and maybe on a drier side. \\n\\nI\\'m not a mac-n-cheese person, but I thought I\\'d give it a try since I saw every person in front of me getting it, and it still didn\\'t change my mind afterwards :); I think I should have got green beans instead. On the brighter side, their pickles and jalapeños were tasty!\\n\\nOverall, about .35 lb of brisket, a bit over half lb of pork ribs, and one side ended up around $26.50 before tips--more than enough to fill me up! I might give a couple other BBQ places a try before deciding whether I\\'d want to return here. I\\'ve been missing out! They\\'ve got the best beef ribs and the most awesome creamed corn I\\'ve ever had! I am a bbq lover and trust me,  They know what they\\'re doing! The brisket is very good. Most places you tell them moist and you get big chunks of fat instead of meat. Not here,  moist means moist here! They\\'ve got great sweet tea as well. Hubbie had brisket and sausage and raved about it. I\\'ll surely be back! So wonderful...moist, delicious and not salty! Great flavor, good variety of sides, and amazing peach cobbler. These guys have the right recipe!!! Terry Black\\'s is my favorite BBQ in Austin. Reminds me of Franklin\\'s without the wait and where the  sides are not an afterthought. T Black\\'s sides are delicious. I get 1/3 juicy brisket (1/2 if I want leftovers, which I always do), one link of spicy jalapeño cheddar sausage, potato salad, cream corn, green beans, the banana pudding and a Shiner Making my mouth water typing this.... going to get my fix now! This was my first time in Austin Texas, my husband has been out here for work and has raved about Terry Black\\'s. Literally the first place he took me to when my plane landed, and let me just say holy crap was this place amazing. I got the brisket, best BBQ I\\'ve ever had. The Mac & Cheese was also really yummy and the corn bread was warm and perfect! The place had cool vibes, service was friendly and again the food was amazing! Spectacular beef brisket! As a self-proclaimed brisket connoisseur, I proclaim Terry Black\\'s to have the best brisket in Austin. And, sad to say this, slightly better brisket than my home of Portland, OR and we do good effin brisket in Portland. Terry\\'s brisket was perfectly moist with melt in your mouth marbled fat. Well done, Terry\\'s, we\\'ll done. I will definitely be back on a future visit and will dream of your brisket until then. \\n\\nAlso, good outdoor dining option for those of you who want to dine-in and feel safe during covid times Need a nap after a late lunch at Terry\\'s . Tasty brisket and greens beans. Came In just before the dinner crowd came barreling in. So friendly staff, nice ambience! I came in here for the first time after a very rough morning. I think even the workers could see that, so they were extremely kind and helpful. This place really brightened my sour day.\\n\\nYou wait in a cafeteria-style line for sides and meat. The turkey breast was quite good and the barbecue sauce was excellent. The cornbread was the BEST THING EVER. It was so sweet and soft. A gigantic muffin for only $1. It was just incredible.\\n\\nPaid $11 and it was enough for two lunches. It can be a quick meal, but they don\\'t mind if you stay longer. Not the best barbecue but definitely the best experience. Thank you to the accommodating staff! Everything I\\'ve gotten here has been so delicious. It was the first place I tried BBQ in Austin, and I keep coming back! I\\'ve brought family & friends here while visiting and they all can\\'t get enough. The brisket is my favorite, but literally everything is delicious. A little bit expensive but totally worth it. Friendly staff too! Best bbq in Texas. We had brisket, pork ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage, Mac n cheese, and pinto beans.  Everything was good and from the smoke looked like they were cooked on site. Great service. Unbelievable BBQ.  Between my colleague, we were able to sample all meats except for the turkey. I would order the same things all over again. My meal consisted of 1 Beef Rib, 1 Pork Rib, 1/3rd lbs. of moist Brisket, small green been, small macaroni and cheese, piece of pecan pie.  This meal set me back $ 57.00.  See picture.  The picture of the smoke ring with deep color bark is from the Beef Rib.  This amount of food could have fed 3 people.  The smallest portion you can purchase is 1/3rd lbs.  The sausage (sold by the 10-inch link only) with jalapeno and cheese my colleague ordered was awesome. In my opinion, Rudy\\'s is better than Franklin\\'s and Black\\'s is better than either.\\n\\nThe brisket is so perfect that the fat becomes a delicacy.  Most of the negative reviews are about the fat... don\\'t throw it away, taste it you won\\'t believe it. Damn, waiting in line to spend $17 per pound it\\'s hard not to feel like you\\'re getting ripped off, but I never spent a better $38 on BBQ in my life. Skip the sides and just load up some complimentary white bread with lean brisket, pickles and hot sauce. Rinse and repeat until they roll you out of there like an oil drum. By far best Texas bbq! Try the pork ribs, be prepared for a line, but enjoy how beautifully they run the restaurant. Went here for lunch based on a recommendation from a friend.\\n\\nArrived a little after 1pm on a Wednesday and there was no line. Walked right in and ordered brisket, pork ribs, cole slaw, beans, and cream corn.\\n\\nI think I may have wasted 4 hours in line at Franklin\\'s...dare I say that Terry Black\\'s is as good or better?\\n\\nThe brisket had a beautiful bark, tender, and well seasoned. A+\\nThe pork ribs were absolute perfection. Juicy, spicy and delicious. A+\\nThe creamed corn was similar to Rudy\\'s, and as a result, it was awesome.\\nWhile the meat did not need any sauce, their sauces were wonderful. I tried the original and sweet mustard style.\\n\\nThe cole slaw was marginal, and I\\'m not a fan of their Texas style beans. \\n\\nTheir sign out front reads, \"Top 50 BBQ in the world\", and I can\\'t argue with that. They\\'re in my top 50! Amazing bbq! They do everything right in order to give you the best bbq around. They can improve the quality of the sides but overall it\\'s worth every dollar. This girl loves some bbq. Wish I could give 5 stars. The beef brisket was a little too tender for my liking.  Seemed a little mushy if that makes sense. The line was long, but bearable. The side dishes like mac n cheese,  potatoe salad, and green beans were delish. Service super friendly. The Employees were very nice it is a good size restaurant on the inside and they have a good parking at the restaurant which is good. \\n\\nThe Food was very good.  we both got the Sausage Sandwich and it was very good  we got the original sausage.  we also got sides as well.  I had the Macaroni and Cheese which was pretty good. and dad got Green Beans as a side  which was also very good \\n\\nThey have Beer and wine \\n\\nThe Meat is sold by the lb.  not as a plate with 2 sides  and they also have Sandwich Combos starting @ 12.00  which includes Chips and a Fountain Drink  you can also upgrade it to a bottled soda or Beer  we just got the Sandwich and 1 Side Awesome bbq! Love that you can scoop your own sides. I really liked the dill-heavy potato salad, Mac and cheese, beans and banana pudding. The fatty brisket was also fantastic, great quality and not overly salty. The variety of sauces were all good, I couldn\\'t pick a favorite. Definitely will come back in future trips. Ooooooo by far one is my favorite barbecue joints. The food the staff the recipes they use and of course the beer. I come here once or twice a month Oh man oh man oh man!  Coming from Boston where all of our bbq sucks...this place is awesome! Got the 2 meat special with juicy brisket and ribs!  Sides were mac and cheese & creamed corn. I also gobbled up a little coleslaw and pickles as well!  Brisket and ribs were so delicious and flavorful!!! Rib meat literally slipped right off the bone and melted in my mouth!  The sides were great as well! May have to come back before I head home later this week! Cafeteria style.  The brisket was incredibly tender, fell off of my fork, and was oh so tasty!  The ribs were perfectly done and delicious.  We loved the green beans, and mac and cheese is to die for.  There wasn\\'t anything we didn\\'t like, it.'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0laSy4r_LEZE"},"source":["result = model(goodRev, num_sentences=10)\n","full = ''.join(result)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"uRXOEt00iIq3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636695546294,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":246,"user":{"displayName":"Lennon Zheng","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi8aZKKVFFQTkerwBjXSGPREF3FSyKY3Kf4cYk_iw=s64","userId":"15127009393047488604"}},"outputId":"c4fd4e15-4d6f-495e-be42-ac8dd62cc0a4"},"source":["print(full)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Tried this location immediately after they opened.

And the guy that complained that the ribs \"fell off the bone\"... It's supposed to do that! Visitors and residents alike enjoy terry blacks delicious barbecue. I nearly died after eating  it all, if you can stand the wait and trying to find a seat it's worth it, also unlike many other places it has great beer pricing. Okay, it's no Franklin's or La Barbecue but hey you don't have to wait hours in line for your food and they have indoor seats with cold  A/C.   My recommendation is to skip the so-so sides and other meats, get the brisket and Blue Bell ice cream. The beef rib is incredible with the best bark (outside of the meat) I've ever had.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Zy8fBaOqsMW9"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
